title: "European Trust Service Status List (TSL)"

The EU Trusted Lists benefits above all to the verification of advanced e-signatures supported by qualified certificates in the meaning of the e-signature directive (1999/93/EC) as far as they have to include at least certification service providers issuing qualified certificates. Member States can however include in their Trusted Lists also other certification service providers.
