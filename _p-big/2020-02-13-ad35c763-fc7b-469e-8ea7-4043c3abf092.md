title: "Web Authentication"
---

The mission of the Web Authentication Working Group, in the Security Activity, is to define a client-side API providing strong authentication functionality to Web Applications.

The Web Authentication Working Group will develop recommendation-track specifications defining an API, as well as signature and attestation formats which provide an asymmetric cryptography-based foundation for authentication of users to Web Applications.

Overall goals include obviating the use of shared secrets, i.e. passwords, as authentication credentials, facilitating multi-factor authentication support as well as hardware-based key storage while respecting the Same Origin Policy.
