title: "Guidelines on Adequacy referential"

The Working Party of EU Data Protection Authorities1 (the WP29)has previously published a Working Document  on  transfers  of  personal  data  to  third  countries  (WP12)2.    With  the  replacement  of  the Directive by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)3, WP29 is revisiting WP12, its earlier guidance, to update it in the context of the new legislation and recent case law of the European Court of Justice (CJEU)4.  This  working  document  seeks  to update Chapter  One  of  WP12  relating  to  the  central  question  of adequate level of data protection in a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that  third  country  or in  an international  organization(hereafter:  "third  countries  or  international organizations"). This document will be continuously reviewed and if necessary updated in the coming years,  based  on  the  practical  experience  gained  through  the  application  of  the  GDPR.   Chapters  2 (Applying the approach to countries that have ratified Convention 108) and 3 (Applying the approach to industry self-regulation) of the WP12 document should be updated at a later stage
