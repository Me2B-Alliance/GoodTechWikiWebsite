More of us are buying smart products for the home that connect to the internet, like personal smart assistants, fitness trackers, toys, and home security systems.  The Connect Smart tips, co-developed by Consumers International and Internet Society, will help you make informed choices about the technology you use in your daily lives. We want to see all consumers getting the best from digital without having to compromise on safety and security.
