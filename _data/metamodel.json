The Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Wien), the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and OwnYourData are the project  partners in this project which is funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails. Consequently, European policy makers have passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has imposed stricter regulations on personal data handling practices within the EU.\n\n\n\n"

The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions.

The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions.

          "description": "Publicly available data from open sources (census.gov: NOAA: data.gov: etc.) are vital resources for students and researchers in a variety of disciplines. Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort.

Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center).

Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails.

We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

As do other users, SMEs benefit from the technical expertise of standards in the elaboration of which they may not have been present. Nevertheless, there are also sometimes advantages to being small as they can adapt quickly, can be more flexible and can have smaller overhead.Furthermore, if standards were to take into consideration the SME perspective, considerable benefits would accrue to all the stakeholders involved in standardization.The aim of this Guide is to raise awareness on the issues that may be of importance to SMEs. By addressing the needs of SMEs, the use of standards may be significantly increased and SMEs will be able to gain the full benefit of utilizing standards.\n\n\n\n"

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment\n\nConformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "International vocabulary of metrology -- Basic and general conceptsand associated terms (VIM)\n\nIn general, a vocabulary is a “terminological dictionary which contains designations and definitions from one or more  specific  subject  fields”  (ISO  1087-1:2000,  3.7.2).  The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

The  treatment  applies  to  a  model  having  any  number  of  input  quantities, and a single output quantity. The   described   Monte   Carlo   method   is   a   practical   alternative   to   the   GUM   uncertainty   framework   [ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008, 3.4.8]. It has value when a)    linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation or b)    the  probability  density  function  (PDF)  for  the  output  quantity  departs  appreciably  from  a  Gaussian  distribution or a scaled and shifted t-distribution, e.g. due to marked asymmetry. In case a), the estimate of the output quantity and the associated standard uncertainty provided by the GUM uncertainty  framework  might  be  unreliable.  In  case  b),  unrealistic  coverage  intervals  (a  generalization  of  “expanded uncertainty” in the GUM uncertainty framework) might be the outcome.\n\n\n\n"

We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment\n\nConformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "International vocabulary of metrology -- Basic and general conceptsand associated terms (VIM)\n\nIn general, a vocabulary is a “terminological dictionary which contains designations and definitions from one or more  specific  subject  fields”  (ISO  1087-1:2000,  3.7.2).  The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

The  treatment  applies  to  a  model  having  any  number  of  input  quantities, and a single output quantity.

It has value when a)    linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation or b)    the  probability  density  function  (PDF)  for  the  output  quantity  departs  appreciably  from  a  Gaussian  distribution or a scaled and shifted t-distribution, e.g. due to marked asymmetry. In case a), the estimate of the output quantity and the associated standard uncertainty provided by the GUM uncertainty  framework  might  be  unreliable.  In  case  b),  unrealistic  coverage  intervals  (a  generalization  of  “expanded uncertainty” in the GUM uncertainty framework) might be the outcome.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry.

What is of concern right now is not that human beings are playing a role in shaping the news — they always have — it is the veneer of objectivity provided by Facebook’s interface, the claims of neutrality enabled by the integration of algorithmic processes, and the assumption that what is prioritized reflects only the interests and actions of the users (the “public sphere”) and not those of Facebook, advertisers, or other powerful entities.\n\nPoints/public spheres: In “Facebook Must Be Accountable to the Public,” danah boyd comments on recent clamor around Facebook’s Trending box and introduces Data & Society’s developing Algorithms and Publics project, including a set of documents occasioned by the Who Controls the Public Sphere in an Era of Algorithms? workshop.\n\n\n\n"

He argues that information algorithms like the ones used to identify “trends” on Facebook do not work alone and cannot work alone and argues that “in so many ways that we must simply discard the fantasy that they do, or ever will.”\n\n    People are in the algorithm because how could they not be? People produce the Facebook activity being measured, people design the algorithms and set their evaluative criteria, people decide what counts as a trend, people name and summarize them, and people look to game the algorithm with their next posts.\n\n    Trending algorithms are undeniably becoming part of the cultural landscape, and revelations like Gizmodo’s are helpful steps in helping us shed the easy notions of what they are and how they work, notions the platforms have fostered. Social media platforms must come to fully realize that they are newsmakers and gatekeepers, whether they intend to be or not, whether they want to be or not. And while algorithms can chew on a lot of data, it is still a substantial, significant, and human process to turn that data into claims about importance that get fed back to millions of users. This is not a realization that they will ever reach on their own — which suggests to me that they need the two countervailing forces that journalism has: a structural commitment to the public, imposed if not inherent, and competition to force them to take such obligations seriously.\n\n\n\n"

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools. Furthermore, the authors find that the information sources that parents favor (InsideSchools and GreatSchools over DOE dashboards) “digest” the data in a way that reinforces the correlation between poverty, minority populations, and low test scores.\n\n\n\n"

Is the failure to account for students with mental illness in a detailed manner the result of stigma?

How might big data be used to identify children in need of mental health treatment in schools to target intervention while protecting students’ privacy?

The fervor over inBloom showed that policies and procedures were not yet where they needed to be for schools to engage in data-informed instruction. Industry members responded with a student data privacy pledge that detailed responsible practice. A strengthened awareness of the need for transparent data practices among nearly all of the involved actors is one of inBloom’s most obvious legacies.\n\n    Instead of a large-scale, open source platform that was a multi-state collaboration, the trend in data-driven educational   technologies since inBloom’s closure has been toward closed, proprietary systems, adopted piecemeal. To date, no large-scale educational technology initiative has succeeded in American K-12  schools. This study explores several factors that contributed to the demise of inBloom and a number of important questions: What were the values and plans that drove inBloom to be designed the way it was?

The paper considers the historic precursors to accountability, as well as the set of political, economic, cultural, and social conditions that led to test scores becoming the main measure of a school’s success.\n\nIn addition to the historical context around accountability, the paper considers important questions about who accountability serves, what the incentive structures are, and how accountability is gamed and resisted. In short, accountability of what, to whom, for what ends, at what cost?\n\nAbstract:\n\n    There is an ongoing tension in the American public education system between the values of excellence, equity, and a sustained commitment to efficiency. Accountability has emerged as a framework in education reform that promises to promote and balance all three values. Yet, this frame is often contested due to disagreements over the role of incentives and penalties in achieving desirable change, and concerns that the proposed mechanisms will have significant unintended consequences that outweigh potential benefits. More fundamentally, there is widespread disagreement over how to quantify excellence and equity, if it is even possible to do so. Accountability rhetoric echoes a broader turn toward data-driven decision-making and resource allocation across sectors. As a tool of power, accountability processes shift authority and control away from professional educators and toward policymakers, bureaucrats, and test makers.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S researcher Monica Bulger, Jonathan Bright, and Cristóbal Cobo investigate why some Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) users organize face-to-face meetings, exploring the hypothesis that meetup invites would reflect students’ learning goals. They also investigate the extent to which these patterns vary between industrialised and developing countries.\n\n    Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer the possibility of entirely virtual learning environments, with lectures, discussions, and assignments all distributed via the internet. The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period. We apply a mixed methods approach to this data, combining large-scale analysis with more in-depth thematic hand coding, to more fully explore the reasons why some learners add a ‘real’ component to their virtual learning experience.\n\n\n\n"

Power users typically show high levels of activity from the beginning of their participation [13]; though studies have also suggested that power users can also learn as they develop [14]. Does the same hold true for online education? 2) Are power learners crucial for starting and maintaining online education communities?

Libraries and librarians are uniquely positioned to prepare all patrons for the privacy challenges brought about by the pervasiveness of data sharing, profiling, collection, and surveillance technologies.”\n\n\n\n"

We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group.

          "description": "We have long warned against the adoption of Big Data analytics as the panacea to society’s woes. We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

The terms of reference were for Mr Anderson to “examine the operational case” for the bulk powers in Parts 6 and 7 of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department. However, it is this database with which facial recognition technology is used by police.\n\n\n\n"

This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up.

It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner.

Information came from books and encyclopaedias not theinternet, in fact the only time you may have used a computer was in a specific information technology lesson and even then there weren’t enough computers for every student to have a go. That vision of school is already out of date and will soon be obsolete.

Retention under this header will notbe authorised by judges. As recognised by the Information Commissioners Office, there remainsno provision for individuals to request the deletion of their DNA and fingerprints.  There is similarly no independent appeal process for those individuals whose DNA and fingerprints the Chief Officerhave refused to destroy.As the data sharing agenda continues apace, Britain continues to put its citizens ata disadvantage internationally by allowing these databases to remain substantially broader than other countries.\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions.

At the same time, media coverage of ways that APIs have been misused has sparked concern for potential privacy invasions and other issues of public policy. This paper seeks to educate consumers on how APIs work and how they are used within popular websites and mobile apps to gather, share, and utilize data.APIs are used in mobile games, search engines, social media platforms, news and shopping websites, video and music streaming services, dating apps, and mobile payment systems. If a third-party company, like an app developer or advertiser, would like to gain access to your information through a website you visit or a mobile app or online service you use, what data might they obtain about you through APIs and how? This report analyzes 11 prominent online services to observe general trends and provide you an overview of the role APIs play in collecting and distributing information about consumers. For example, how might your data be gathered and shared when using your Facebook account login to sign up for Venmo or to access the Tinder dating app?

However, users rarely read them and struggle to understand their con-tents. Also, the entities that provide these policies are sometimes unmotivated to make them com-prehensible.  Recently, annotated corpora of privacy policies have been introduced to the researchcommunity.   They open the door to the development of machine learning and natural languageprocessing techniques to automate the annotation of these documents.  In turn, these annotationscan be passed on to interfaces (e.g., web browser plugins) that help users quickly identify and un-derstand relevant privacy statements. We present advances in extracting privacy policy paragraphs(termedsegmentsin this paper) and individual sentences that relate to expert-identified categoriesof policy contents, using methods in supervised learning. In particular, we show that relevant seg-ments and sentences can be classified with average micro-F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively,improving over prior work.  We discuss how the techniques introduced in this paper have beenused to automatically annotate the text of about 7,000 privacy policies.

To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies.

Some recent efforts have aimed to use a combination ofcrowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies at scale, thusproducing annotations for use in interfaces that inform Internet users of salient policy details. However,little attention has been devoted to studying the accuracy of crowdsourced privacy policy annotations, howcrowdworker productivity can be enhanced for such a task, and the levels of granularity that are feasible forautomatic analysis of privacy policies. In this article, we present a trajectory of work addressing each of thesetopics. We include analyses of crowdworker performance, evaluation of a method to make a privacy-policyoriented task easier for crowdworkers, a coarse-grained approach to labeling segments of policy text withdescriptive themes, and a fine-grained approach to identifying user choices described in policy text. Together,the results from these efforts show the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods forextracting from privacy policies the data practice details that are salient to Internet users’ interests\n\n\n\n"

Research has shownthat few users take the time to read these policies, as they areoften long and difficult to understand. In addition, users oftenonly care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacypolicies, and some of the issues they actually care about maynot even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather thanrequiring users to read the policies, a better approach might beto allow them to simply ask questions about those issues theycare about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, wetake a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an au-tomated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at thekinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system.This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits pri-vacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practicesof mobile apps.

The length of these policiesand their often convoluted language have been shown to discourage most users fromreading them.  Recent progress in natural language processing and machine learninghas opened the door to the development of technologies that are capable of automati-cally extracting statements (or “annotations”) from the text of privacy policies.  Thesetechnologies could help users quickly identify those elements of a privacy notice theycare about - without requiring them to read the full text of the notice.In  this  article,  we  review  the  requirements  associated  with  the  development  ofQuery Answering functionality that would enable users to ask questions about spe-cific aspects of privacy notices (e.g. Does this app share my location with third parties?Am I able to review the information this website collects about me?  Can I delete myaccount?   For how long is my information going to be retained by this company?).We  discuss  different  possible  approaches  to  supporting  such  functionality  and  howthey relate to recent advances in automatically annotating privacy notices.  Initial re-sults obtained with different machine learning/natural language processing techniquesare presented, suggesting that Query Answering functionality could be a particularlypromising approach to informing users about privacy practices.  In particular, in con-trast to automated annotation techniques that aim to extract detailed statements fromthe text of privacy notices, Query Answering functionality could be configured to re-turn short text fragments extracted from privacy notices and rely on the user (ratherthan the computer) to interpret some of the finer nuances of the text found in thesefragments. Such an approach could potentially prove more robust than fully automatedannotation techniques,  which at least at this time struggle with the interpretation offiner nuances.\n\n\n\n"

Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot's top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.\n\n\n\n"

Privacy policies, however, remain long, complex, and impractical for consumers. Communicating in some short-hand form, synthesized privacy content is now crucial to empower internet users and provide them more meaningful notice, as well as nudge consumers and data processors toward more meaningful privacy. Indeed, on the basis of these needs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as lawmakers and policymakers in the European Union, have advocated for the development of privacy indicator systems.\n\n\n\n"

Since consent is deemed necessary and part of a social contract for fairness, however, without meaningful consent, that social contract is effectively broken and the best intent of our laws undermined.\n\nOur research challenges to address this gap are interdisciplinary: meaningful consent has implications for transforming current digital economy data practices; change will require potentially new business models, and certainly new forms of interaction to highlight policy without over burdening citizens as we go about our business. We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group.

Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph.

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Within some public policy and scholarly accounts, human trafficking is increasingly understood as a technological problem that invites collaborative anti-trafficking solutions. A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t. This is partially due to the fact that universities typically like to stick to research rather than implementation, but one could also foresee some serious legal challenges to investigations based on data mining rather than evidence or specific complaints.”\n\nDerrick Harris, Why big data has some big problems when it comes to public policy, GigaOm, August 28, 2014\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

Methods for the adoption of International Deliverables other  than  International  Standards  (such  as  Technical  Specifications,  Publicly  Available  Specifications,  Technical  Reports,  Guides,  Technology  Trend  Assessments,  Industry  Technical  Agreements,  International  Workshop  Agreements)  are  given  in  ISO/IEC  Guide  21-2.  Greater  uniformity  in  the  indication  of  both  correspondence and deviations among countries will aid communication, avoid confusion and facilitate trade. 0.2 International   Standards   are   widely   adopted   at   the   regional   or   national   level   and   applied   by   manufacturers,  trade  organizations,  purchasers,  consumers,  testing  laboratories,  authorities  and  other  interested  parties.  Since  these  standards  generally  reflect  the  best  experience  of  industry,  researchers,  consumers and regulators worldwide, and cover common needs in a variety of countries, they constitute one of the important bases for the removal of technical barriers to trade. This has been explicitly acknowledged in the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization (WTO TBT Agreement). It  is  important  that  every  effort  be  made  to  adopt  and  use  International  Standards  as  regional  or  national  standards  and,  consequently,  to  withdraw  conflicting  regional  or  national  standards  as  soon  as  practicable  for  the reasons mentioned above. Only by developing a global approach can the benefits of standardization be fully realized.  However,  full  adoption  may  not  be  practicable  in  all  cases  for  reasons  such  as  regional  or  national  security,  protection  of  human  health  or  safety,  or  protection  of  the  environment,  or  because  of  fundamental  climatic, geographical or technological problems. The WTO TBT Agreement recognizes that these are legitimate reasons for regional or national deviations.\n\n\n\n"

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The first edition of this Guide was published by ISO in 1976. It was prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission  for  Europe  (UN/ECE)  in  consultation  with  ISO,  primarily  to  facilitate  the  work  of  the  UN/ECE  aimed  at  removal  of  barriers  to  international  trade  arising  from  lack  of  harmonization  of  standards  or  inadequate international application of standards. The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC. To guard against terminological inconsistencies, a clear understanding  of  basic  concepts  needed  to  be  established,  and  unambiguous  general  terms  and  definitions  provided.\n\n\n\n"

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

However, while its intended audience are standards developers, this Guide contains information that can also be useful to other people, such as manufacturers, designers, service providers and educators.The second edition of this Guide, retitled “Guide for addressing accessibility in standards,” builds upon the edition published in 2001, titled “Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities”. This edition takes account of developments in thinking and practice which have taken place since 2001 and takes a more inclusive approach. This edition also sets out to improve the usability and adoption of the Guide itself. This Guide, like its predecessor, is intended to be part of the overall framework that standards bodies can use in their efforts to support the development of systems that suit the needs of diverse users.It is an important goal for the whole of society that all people, regardless of their age, size or ability, have access to the broadest range of systems. Issues of accessibility to and usability of systems have become more critical as the number of people (such as older persons, children, persons with reduced abilities and persons with disabilities) with diverse user accessibility needs has increased.\n\n\n\n"

Standards help to harmonize technical and other specifications of products and services making industry more efficient and removing barriers to trade.Standards are considered an essential component of the “quality infrastructure”, the system comprising organizations (public and private), policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework and practices which is needed to support and enhance the quality, safety, and sustainable soundness of goods, services and processes.Standards are developed by many bodies, at the national, regional and international levels. Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level. ISO and IEC, together with their national bodies, are responsible for fostering and ensuring coherence and coordination.The ISO and IEC system for standardization is based on collaboration agreements between ISO and IEC and an extensive array of collaboration agreements among regional, national and other standards bodies\n\n\n\n"

Asthe tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertaintybecomes  more  important  when  assessing  conformity  to  these  tolerances.   Measurement  uncertainty  plays  acentral role in quality assessment and quality standards.Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial,  commercial,scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental.  Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities.Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context ofconformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement,and to manage the consequential risks.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV.

This is achieved by advancing novel cryptographic technologies and improving strong authentication mechanisms.\n\n \n Summary\nWith increasing mobility and Internet usage, the demand for digital services increases and has reached critical and high assurance domains like e-Government, e-Health and e-Business. Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. In order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services. To empirically evaluate our work and to produce outputs of a high technical readiness we will consider use cases from all three domains mentioned above.\n\nThe project CREDENTIAL is scheduled for 36 months and the work plan is defined in accordance with the objectives of the project, and organised according to the expertise of the partners. The work plan is organised in seven work packages and their relation and interdependencies is shown in the figure.\n\nThe CREDENTIAL consortium is composed of a balanced team of 5 industry partners, 2 applied research organisations, an SMEs and 3 universities, which are complementary in their expertise and have strong experience in their respective fields, i.e. identify and access management, cloud computing, information security and usability aspects. The partners are from 7 different EU member states and they were carefully selected to cover the complete value chain from theory to practice to maximize the impact and exploitation potential.\n\n\n\n"

Whilst the service provider may request various data items, the user always controls the data to be sent. The explicit consent of the owner of the data, the user, is always required before his data can be sent to the service provider.\n\nThe platform will not store any personal data, so no data can be lost.\n\nThis user centric approach was not taken to satisfy some philosophical preferences, but in line with the legislative requirements of all the various countries involved that oblige concrete measures to be taken to guarantee that a citizen's fundamental rights, such as his privacy, are respected.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "The European Information Society (EIS) requires technologies which address trust and security yet also preserve the privacy of individuals. As the EIS develops, the increasingly digital representation of personal characteristics changes our ways of identifying individuals, and supplementary digital identities, so-called virtual identities, embodying concepts such as pseudonymity and anonymity, are being created for security, profit, convenience or even for fun. These new identities are feeding back into the world of social and business affairs, offering a mix of plural identities and challenging traditional notions of identity. At the same time, European states manage identities in very different ways. For example, in Germany holding an ID card is mandatory for every adult, while in the UK state-issued ID cards do not exist. FIDIS objectives are shaping the requirements for the future management of identity in the EIS and contributing to the technologies and infrastructures needed.\n\nAs a multidisciplinary and multinational NoE FIDIS, appropriately, comprises different country research experiences with heterogeneous focuses, and integrates European expertise around a common set of activities. Additionally, all relevant stakeholders are addressed to ensure that the requirements are considered from different levels. FIDIS overcomes the extreme fragmentation of research into the future of identity by consolidating and fostering joint research in this area. Research results will be made accessible to European citizens, researchers and in particular to SMEs. FIDIS will accomplish ERA objectives by durably integrating the research implementation efforts, as well as the medium term target setting, and in the long run the strategic objective planning.\n\nOur Objectives:\nIntegrating European research with regard to Technologies to:\n* Support identity and identification\n* Interoperability of identity and identification concepts\n* ID-theft, privacy and security\n *Profiling and forensic implications\n\nOur Results:\n* Integrated approaches to research\n* Legal, socio-economic, usability and application requirements.\n* Public architecture & specifications.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "title": "The Trafficking-Technology Nexus",
          "description": "Within some public policy and scholarly accounts, human trafficking is increasingly understood as a technological problem that invites collaborative anti-trafficking solutions. A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

And that auditing for fraud requires entire populations to be tracked using their personal data. And that experimental technologies will work as planned in a chaotic conflict setting. And last, that the ethics of consent don’t apply for people who are starving.”\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t. This is partially due to the fact that universities typically like to stick to research rather than implementation, but one could also foresee some serious legal challenges to investigations based on data mining rather than evidence or specific complaints.”\n\nDerrick Harris, Why big data has some big problems when it comes to public policy, GigaOm, August 28, 2014\n\n\n\n"

We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department.

Wewelcome   the   opportunity   to   provide   briefing   ahead   of   this   debate   and   seek   to   informparliamentarians of the significant risks live facial recognition surveillance poses to humanrights and the rule of law in the UK.A   threat   to   freedom:   The   emergence   of   live   facial   recognition   surveillance   bypolice   in   England   and   Wales   poses  one   of   the   most   serious   threats   to   civilliberties   of   recent   years.   This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

However it is unfortunate thatsome companies are better than others at explainingto their customers theoptions available to them. Indeed some companies are not being completelyclear that a smart meter is an option and not a service the customer has to sign up to.  This is not acceptable.

This one example alone shows that ill-considered and poorly executed data sharing often makes the vulnerable even more so. It wasdetermined by the Supreme Court3earlier in the year that sharing personal information for the benefit of “wellbeing” failed to meet the high bar set by the Data Protection Act which says data use must be “vital”.\n\n\n\n"

We will now hear evidence from Big Brother Watch and the Open Rights Group. For this session we again have broadly half an hour to 45 minutes. Will the witnesses please read their names into the record?\n\nJim Killock: I am Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group.\n\nRenate Samson: I am Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch. We were also a member of the open policy making group and the Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group, to which Dr Whitley referred to earlier.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you. I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.\n\n\n\n"

Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry.

Establishing roaming between network operators is based on – and the commercial terms are contained in – dedicated roaming agreements.\n\nIf the visited network is in the same country as the home network, this is known as national roaming. If the visited network is outside the home country, this is known as international roaming.\n\nIf the visited network operates on a different technical standard than the home network, this is known as inter-standard roaming.\n\nGSM Roaming, which involves roaming between GSM networks, offers the mobile subscriber the convenience of being able to use a single number, a single bill and a single phone in up to 219 countries. The convenience of GSM Roaming has been a key driver behind the global success of the GSM Platform.\n\n\n\n"

It was to be a collaborative space for all mankind.\n\nHowever, when the first browser that popularized the web came along, called Mosaic, it included multimedia and editing was taken out. It was considered too difficult a problem. This change was the first curtailing of the web’s promise and spawned an effort led by Tim and others to get the write functionality back.

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates.

          "description": "In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals —from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.\n\n\n\n"

Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept.To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it.

Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.\n\n\n\n"

The term decentralizedmeans that the governance of the data may not reside with a single party. A related concept is that the trust in the data provenance is difuse in nature. Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifer) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a frst order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery.

This means demonstrating control of the DID using the mechanismspecified in the DID Document's \"authentication\" object. This could take place using a number of different data formats, protocols, and flows. DID Auth includes the ability to establish mutually authenticated communication channels and to authenticate to web sites and applications. Authorization, Verifiable Credentials, and Capabilities are built on top of DID Auth and are out of scope for this document. This paper gives on overview of the scope of DID Auth, supported protocols and flows, and the use of components of the DID Documents that are relevant to authentication, as well as formats for challenges and responses.\n\n\n\n"

They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information.While there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic defnition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By defning these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the diferent ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and analysis into specifc factors in a structured way.\n\n\n\n"

Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email2, but there are many opportunities to go further.By attaching public keys to the profles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity ofmessages sent over the network.By using a decentralized identifer system such as Decentralized Identifers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system3, by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certifcate authorities.At this point, users could even optionally transition from a client-server model system to a fully peer-to-peer system\n\n\n\n"

Each  DID  uses  a  specific DID  method, defined   in   a   separate DID   method   specification,   to define  how  the  DID  is  registered,  resolved,  updated,  and revoked on a specific distributed ledger or network.\n\n\n\n"

New    technology    and    automated    systems,    encompassing    artificial intelligence, machine learningand big data analyticsare being used ever more widely in the criminal  justice  system.  These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice. The protections afforded to individuals subject  to  these  biased,  unfair  or  unjust decisions  are  minimal.

Clearly this is an issue and law enforcement has tobe able to respond effectively. Key to helping the police deal with the risingnumber ofconcerns is the idea of registering drones. Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners.

Biometrics now extends to but is not limited to DNA, facial search, gait, iris recognition, speech recognition, facial recognition. While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner.

          "description": "The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) community has described several groundbreaking properties that arise from the adoption of its principles. Governance, as in business and fnancing structure, is arguably the most challenging of these properties, captured succinctly by Shoshana Zubof as: \"Who decides? Who decides who decides?\" However,even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years, bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any functional domain.A RWOT6 paper explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general implications of introducing a credential holder into existing issuer/verifer relationships? Our analysis leads to cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder (the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifers already exist. The healthcare industry is used as an example.\n\n\n\n"

Such systems are inherently empowering to users but safeguarding keys is a hard problem.We focus on the social recovery of control of an identifer. There are several techniques to re-assert control over identifers including key recovery and issuance of a new key. In many situations it is preferrable to establish a newkey than recover the old one.We propose a rubrik for evaluating such schemes, and give a brief overview of possible schemes to consider.\n\n\n\n"

For more information about DIDs and DID method specifcations, please see the DID Primer and DID Spec.\"This document defnes a 'peer' DID Method that can be used independent of any source of truth external to the relationship in which it is used. The method is cheap, fast, scalable, and secure. It is suitable for most private relationships between people, organizations, and IoT things. DIDs associated with this method are also promotable to a more public context. That is, blockchains with diferent DID methods can graft some or all peer DIDs into their namespace(s) with no risk of accidental collision, and no loss of meaning. Peer DID will have a recognizable and consistent identity in all of them.\"\n\n\n\n"

In December 2018, the W3C held a Strong Authentication and Identity Workshop that determined that a reasonable next step would be to create a W3C Working Group to standardize the DID specifcation. As a result, the W3C Credentials Community Group, whichhas been incubating the specifcation, will eventually need to hand the specifcation over to the newly formed W3C DID Working Group. In preparation for this hand of, a group at Rebooting the Web of Trust triaged issuesrelated to the DID specifcation, refned existing proposals related to the specifcation, and gathered new features and requirements from the community. The result of this work is outlined in this document.\n\n\n\n"

The use of publicly available, corporate, and government data sets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. Secondary data use invokes privacy and consent concerns. A team at Data & Society recently conducted interviews and campus visits with computer science researchers and librarians at eight U.S. universities to examine the role of research librarians in assisting technical researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.\n\n\n\n"

The use of publicly available, corporate, and government data sets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. Secondary data use invokes privacy and consent concerns. A team at Data & Society recently conducted interviews and campus visits with computer science researchers and librarians at eight U.S. universities to examine the role of research librarians in assisting technical researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.\n\n\n\n"

These support systems have varying levels of coordination and may be implicit or explicit.\n\nAs part of the Supporting Ethics in Data Research project at Data & Society, we held workshops with twelve to sixteen student researchers,professors, information technology leaders, repository managers, and research librarians at a handful of universities. The goal was to tease out the individual components of ethical, technical, and legal support that were available or absent on each campus, and to better understand the interactions between different actors as they encounter common ethical quandaries.\n\n\n\n"

Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center).

Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails.

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort.

Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails.

We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

Asthe tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertaintybecomes  more  important  when  assessing  conformity  to  these  tolerances.   Measurement  uncertainty  plays  acentral role in quality assessment and quality standards.Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial,  commercial,scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental.  Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities.Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context ofconformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement,and to manage the consequential risks.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment\n\nConformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them.

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry.

Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools.

However, Caplan and co-writer Philip M.

Companies such as Google, Facebook, BuzzFeed, and Twitter have argued that it is inaccurate to think of them as media companies. Rather, they argue that they should be thought of as technology companies. The logic of this position, and its implications for communications policy, have yet to be thoroughly analyzed. However, such an analysis is increasingly necessary as the dynamics of news and information production, dissemination, and consumption continue to evolve. This paper will explore and critique the logic and motivations behind the position that these content providers/aggregators are technology companies rather than media companies, as well as the communications policy implications associated with accepting or rejecting this position.\n\n\n\n"

He argues that information algorithms like the ones used to identify “trends” on Facebook do not work alone and cannot work alone and argues that “in so many ways that we must simply discard the fantasy that they do, or ever will.”\n\n    People are in the algorithm because how could they not be? People produce the Facebook activity being measured, people design the algorithms and set their evaluative criteria, people decide what counts as a trend, people name and summarize them, and people look to game the algorithm with their next posts.\n\n    Trending algorithms are undeniably becoming part of the cultural landscape, and revelations like Gizmodo’s are helpful steps in helping us shed the easy notions of what they are and how they work, notions the platforms have fostered. Social media platforms must come to fully realize that they are newsmakers and gatekeepers, whether they intend to be or not, whether they want to be or not. And while algorithms can chew on a lot of data, it is still a substantial, significant, and human process to turn that data into claims about importance that get fed back to millions of users. This is not a realization that they will ever reach on their own — which suggests to me that they need the two countervailing forces that journalism has: a structural commitment to the public, imposed if not inherent, and competition to force them to take such obligations seriously.\n\n\n\n"

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools. Furthermore, the authors find that the information sources that parents favor (InsideSchools and GreatSchools over DOE dashboards) “digest” the data in a way that reinforces the correlation between poverty, minority populations, and low test scores.\n\n\n\n"

How might big data be used to identify children in need of mental health treatment in schools to target intervention while protecting students’ privacy?

The fervor over inBloom showed that policies and procedures were not yet where they needed to be for schools to engage in data-informed instruction. Industry members responded with a student data privacy pledge that detailed responsible practice. A strengthened awareness of the need for transparent data practices among nearly all of the involved actors is one of inBloom’s most obvious legacies.\n\n    Instead of a large-scale, open source platform that was a multi-state collaboration, the trend in data-driven educational   technologies since inBloom’s closure has been toward closed, proprietary systems, adopted piecemeal. To date, no large-scale educational technology initiative has succeeded in American K-12  schools. This study explores several factors that contributed to the demise of inBloom and a number of important questions: What were the values and plans that drove inBloom to be designed the way it was?

The paper considers the historic precursors to accountability, as well as the set of political, economic, cultural, and social conditions that led to test scores becoming the main measure of a school’s success.\n\nIn addition to the historical context around accountability, the paper considers important questions about who accountability serves, what the incentive structures are, and how accountability is gamed and resisted. In short, accountability of what, to whom, for what ends, at what cost?\n\nAbstract:\n\n    There is an ongoing tension in the American public education system between the values of excellence, equity, and a sustained commitment to efficiency. Accountability has emerged as a framework in education reform that promises to promote and balance all three values. Yet, this frame is often contested due to disagreements over the role of incentives and penalties in achieving desirable change, and concerns that the proposed mechanisms will have significant unintended consequences that outweigh potential benefits. More fundamentally, there is widespread disagreement over how to quantify excellence and equity, if it is even possible to do so. Accountability rhetoric echoes a broader turn toward data-driven decision-making and resource allocation across sectors. As a tool of power, accountability processes shift authority and control away from professional educators and toward policymakers, bureaucrats, and test makers.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S researcher Monica Bulger, Jonathan Bright, and Cristóbal Cobo investigate why some Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) users organize face-to-face meetings, exploring the hypothesis that meetup invites would reflect students’ learning goals. They also investigate the extent to which these patterns vary between industrialised and developing countries.\n\n    Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer the possibility of entirely virtual learning environments, with lectures, discussions, and assignments all distributed via the internet. The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period. We apply a mixed methods approach to this data, combining large-scale analysis with more in-depth thematic hand coding, to more fully explore the reasons why some learners add a ‘real’ component to their virtual learning experience.\n\n\n\n"

This article examines the policy response from both the Global North and South to young people’s online behaviour that may challenge adult conceptions of what is acceptable, within existing legal and policy frameworks. It asks whether the ‘childhood innocence’ implied in much protection discourse is a helpful basis for promoting children’s rights in the digital age. Based on a comparative analysis of the emerging policy trends in Europe, South Africa and the United States, the article assesses the implications for policymakers and child welfare specialists as they attempt to redraw the balance between children’s online safety while supporting their agency as digital citizens.\n\n\n\n"

Power users typically show high levels of activity from the beginning of their participation [13]; though studies have also suggested that power users can also learn as they develop [14]. Does the same hold true for online education? 2) Are power learners crucial for starting and maintaining online education communities?

Research done in part with collaboration from Brooklyn Public Library found that frontline library staff required training and ongoing support to better respond to patron needs regarding digital privacy or data profiling issues.1 The Data Privacy Project aims to meet that need. With additional training and easy step- by-step resource guides and straightforward training materials, we believe that libraries will be more likely to live up to their professional commitment to protecting patron privacy.\n\n    As the Internet and its usage continue to influence and shape our lives, the issues of digital privacy and data profiling are central to policymaking and public debate. The extent of government surveillance programs, differential treatment of online consumers, and the need for protection of sensitive personal data have increased the urgency of addressing these matters.\n\n\n\n"

Individuals with the greatest digital literacy needs are also the most vulnerable to abuses of personal data.

We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group.

          "description": "We have long warned against the adoption of Big Data analytics as the panacea to society’s woes. We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

The terms of reference were for Mr Anderson to “examine the operational case” for the bulk powers in Parts 6 and 7 of the Investigatory Powers Bill. Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department. However, it is this database with which facial recognition technology is used by police.\n\n\n\n"

Wewelcome   the   opportunity   to   provide   briefing   ahead   of   this   debate   and   seek   to   informparliamentarians of the significant risks live facial recognition surveillance poses to humanrights and the rule of law in the UK.A   threat   to   freedom:   The   emergence   of   live   facial   recognition   surveillance   bypolice   in   England   and   Wales   poses  one   of   the   most   serious   threats   to   civilliberties   of   recent   years.   This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start.

Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners.

While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner.

The sums of money involved are massive and it’s important that those charged with delivering this service get it right.My team is developing a process –a 'Passport to Compliance' –which will allow local authorities to follow an incremental and intelligent approach to considering whether a new surveillance camera system is essential.

Information came from books and encyclopaedias not theinternet, in fact the only time you may have used a computer was in a specific information technology lesson and even then there weren’t enough computers for every student to have a go. That vision of school is already out of date and will soon be obsolete.  The analogue classroom of old has been replaced with smartboards, internet connected devices and communication via instant message.  And rightly so.

The overwhelming majority of police forces are unable to distinguish the profiles of those convicted to those not charged, let alone found innocent.

Because of this, our research suggests the costof implementing the Protectionof Freedoms Actwill be double the Government’s own estimate, also casting serious doubt on the accuracy of the on-goingcosts of implementation. Whilstmaking good progress, the Protection of Freedoms Actdoes not fulfil the Coalition agreement’s pledge toimplement the Scottish model,with a broad discretionary power to retain DNA for ‘national security’purposes that was highlighted by the Joint Committee on Human Rights as a serious concern. Retention under this header will notbe authorised by judges. As recognised by the Information Commissioners Office, there remainsno provision for individuals to request the deletion of their DNA and fingerprints.  There is similarly no independent appeal process for those individuals whose DNA and fingerprints the Chief Officerhave refused to destroy.As the data sharing agenda continues apace, Britain continues to put its citizens ata disadvantage internationally by allowing these databases to remain substantially broader than other countries.\n\n\n\n"

Whilst  the  world's  largest  companies  are  profiting  from  tracking,  analysing  and  quantifying  every 'consumer', the state is building the most totalitarian style surveillance regime  of  any  democracy  in  history  under  the  Investigatory  Powers  Act  2016.We have long warned of the harms of omnipresent surveillance to society as a whole - and this year, the risk that constant data collection poses to our democracy finally caused public concern after the Cambridge Analytical scandal. However, for some groups, the harms of normalised pervasive and intrusive monitoring practices are particularly tangible. This  report  tells  the  experiences  of  those  groups.  It  tells  the  stories  of  campaigners  and  unionists  who  are  targeted  by  state  surveillance  simply  for engaging in peaceful protest; of people too scared to access healthcare because   of   insidious   government   data   sharing   schemes;   of   welfare   recipients afraid to reap the benefits of social media for fear their posts will be used against them.\n\n\n\n"

Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions. We believe this taxonomy and the patterns can help policy analysts discover missing or underspecified purposes to better comply with the collection and use limitation principles.\n\n\n\n"

Newsworthy events, including those involving Facebook’s API and Cambridge Analytica obtaining information about millions of Facebook users, have highlighted the technical capabilities of APIs for prominent websites and mobile applications. At the same time, media coverage of ways that APIs have been misused has sparked concern for potential privacy invasions and other issues of public policy. This paper seeks to educate consumers on how APIs work and how they are used within popular websites and mobile apps to gather, share, and utilize data.APIs are used in mobile games, search engines, social media platforms, news and shopping websites, video and music streaming services, dating apps, and mobile payment systems. If a third-party company, like an app developer or advertiser, would like to gain access to your information through a website you visit or a mobile app or online service you use, what data might they obtain about you through APIs and how? This report analyzes 11 prominent online services to observe general trends and provide you an overview of the role APIs play in collecting and distributing information about consumers. For example, how might your data be gathered and shared when using your Facebook account login to sign up for Venmo or to access the Tinder dating app? How might advertisers use Pandora’s API when you are streaming music?\n\n\n\n"

However, users rarely read them and struggle to understand their con-tents. Also, the entities that provide these policies are sometimes unmotivated to make them com-prehensible.  Recently, annotated corpora of privacy policies have been introduced to the researchcommunity.   They open the door to the development of machine learning and natural languageprocessing techniques to automate the annotation of these documents.  In turn, these annotationscan be passed on to interfaces (e.g., web browser plugins) that help users quickly identify and un-derstand relevant privacy statements. We present advances in extracting privacy policy paragraphs(termedsegmentsin this paper) and individual sentences that relate to expert-identified categoriesof policy contents, using methods in supervised learning. In particular, we show that relevant seg-ments and sentences can be classified with average micro-F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively,improving over prior work.  We discuss how the techniques introduced in this paper have beenused to automatically annotate the text of about 7,000 privacy policies.

To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies. The patterns match information type hyponyms with an average precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.74.\n\n\n\n"

We present an extensive content analysis of a stratified sample of 150 English-language websites, assessing the usability and interaction paths of their data deletion options and opt-outs for email communications and targeted advertising. This heuristic evaluation identified substantial issues that likely make exercising these privacy choices on many websites difficult and confusing for US-based consumers. Even though the majority of analyzed websites offered privacy choices, they were located inconsistently across websites. Furthermore, some privacy choices were rendered unusable by missing or unhelpful information, or by links that did not lead to the stated choice.

While research shows that Internet userscare about their privacy, they do not have the time to understand the policies of every website they visit,and most users hardly ever read privacy policies. Some recent efforts have aimed to use a combination ofcrowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies at scale, thusproducing annotations for use in interfaces that inform Internet users of salient policy details. However,little attention has been devoted to studying the accuracy of crowdsourced privacy policy annotations, howcrowdworker productivity can be enhanced for such a task, and the levels of granularity that are feasible forautomatic analysis of privacy policies. In this article, we present a trajectory of work addressing each of thesetopics. We include analyses of crowdworker performance, evaluation of a method to make a privacy-policyoriented task easier for crowdworkers, a coarse-grained approach to labeling segments of policy text withdescriptive themes, and a fine-grained approach to identifying user choices described in policy text. Together,the results from these efforts show the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods forextracting from privacy policies the data practice details that are salient to Internet users’ interests\n\n\n\n"

Research has shownthat few users take the time to read these policies, as they areoften long and difficult to understand. In addition, users oftenonly care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacypolicies, and some of the issues they actually care about maynot even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather thanrequiring users to read the policies, a better approach might beto allow them to simply ask questions about those issues theycare about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, wetake a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an au-tomated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at thekinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system.This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits pri-vacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practicesof mobile apps. We analyze 1350 questions posed by crowd-workers  about  the  privacy  practices  of  a  diverse  cross  sec-tion of mobile applications.

The length of these policiesand their often convoluted language have been shown to discourage most users fromreading them.  Recent progress in natural language processing and machine learninghas opened the door to the development of technologies that are capable of automati-cally extracting statements (or “annotations”) from the text of privacy policies.  Thesetechnologies could help users quickly identify those elements of a privacy notice theycare about - without requiring them to read the full text of the notice.In  this  article,  we  review  the  requirements  associated  with  the  development  ofQuery Answering functionality that would enable users to ask questions about spe-cific aspects of privacy notices (e.g. Does this app share my location with third parties?Am I able to review the information this website collects about me?  Can I delete myaccount?   For how long is my information going to be retained by this company?).We  discuss  different  possible  approaches  to  supporting  such  functionality  and  howthey relate to recent advances in automatically annotating privacy notices.  Initial re-sults obtained with different machine learning/natural language processing techniquesare presented, suggesting that Query Answering functionality could be a particularlypromising approach to informing users about privacy practices.  In particular, in con-trast to automated annotation techniques that aim to extract detailed statements fromthe text of privacy notices, Query Answering functionality could be configured to re-turn short text fragments extracted from privacy notices and rely on the user (ratherthan the computer) to interpret some of the finer nuances of the text found in thesefragments. Such an approach could potentially prove more robust than fully automatedannotation techniques,  which at least at this time struggle with the interpretation offiner nuances.\n\n\n\n"

These policies are often long and difficult to comprehend. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot's top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Semantic Web, 9, 2, Jan 2018\n\nPrivacy policies are intended to inform users about the collection and use of their data by websites, mobile apps and other services or appliances they interact with. This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis.\n\n\n\n"

Privacy policies, however, remain long, complex, and impractical for consumers. Communicating in some short-hand form, synthesized privacy content is now crucial to empower internet users and provide them more meaningful notice, as well as nudge consumers and data processors toward more meaningful privacy. Indeed, on the basis of these needs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as lawmakers and policymakers in the European Union, have advocated for the development of privacy indicator systems.\n\n\n\n"

Since consent is deemed necessary and part of a social contract for fairness, however, without meaningful consent, that social contract is effectively broken and the best intent of our laws undermined.\n\nOur research challenges to address this gap are interdisciplinary: meaningful consent has implications for transforming current digital economy data practices; change will require potentially new business models, and certainly new forms of interaction to highlight policy without over burdening citizens as we go about our business. We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort.

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "D&S fellow Mark Latonero considers recent attempts by policymakers, big tech companies, and advocates to address the deepening refugee and migrant crisis and, in particular, the educational needs of displaced children through technology and app development projects. He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Within some public policy and scholarly accounts, human trafficking is increasingly understood as a technological problem that invites collaborative anti-trafficking solutions. A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t. This is partially due to the fact that universities typically like to stick to research rather than implementation, but one could also foresee some serious legal challenges to investigations based on data mining rather than evidence or specific complaints.”\n\nDerrick Harris, Why big data has some big problems when it comes to public policy, GigaOm, August 28, 2014\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

Since  these  standards  generally  reflect  the  best  experience  of  industry,  researchers,  consumers and regulators worldwide, and cover common needs in a variety of countries, they constitute one of the important bases for the removal of technical barriers to trade.

However,  full  adoption  may  not  be  practicable  in  all  cases  for  reasons  such  as  regional  or  national  security,  protection  of  human  health  or  safety,  or  protection  of  the  environment,  or  because  of  fundamental  climatic, geographical or technological problems. The WTO TBT Agreement recognizes that these are legitimate reasons for regional or national deviations.\n\n\n\n"

National bodies that are members of ISO   or   IEC   participate   in   the   development   of   International   Standards   through   technical   committees   established  by  the  respective  organization  to  deal  with  particular  fields  of  technical  activity.  ISO  and  IEC  technical  committees  collaborate  in  fields  of  mutual  interest.  Other  international  organizations,  governmental  and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISI/IEC Directives, Part 2. Draft  Guides  adopted  by  the  responsible  Committee  or  Group  are  circulated  to  national  bodies  for  voting.  Publication as a Guide requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. The first edition of this Guide was published by ISO in 1976. It was prepared by the United Nations Economic Commission  for  Europe  (UN/ECE)  in  consultation  with  ISO,  primarily  to  facilitate  the  work  of  the  UN/ECE  aimed  at  removal  of  barriers  to  international  trade  arising  from  lack  of  harmonization  of  standards  or  inadequate international application of standards. The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC. To guard against terminological inconsistencies, a clear understanding  of  basic  concepts  needed  to  be  established,  and  unambiguous  general  terms  and  definitions  provided.\n\n\n\n"

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

It provides guidance for developing and writing appropriate accessibility requirements and recommendations in standards. However, while its intended audience are standards developers, this Guide contains information that can also be useful to other people, such as manufacturers, designers, service providers and educators.The second edition of this Guide, retitled “Guide for addressing accessibility in standards,” builds upon the edition published in 2001, titled “Guidelines for standards developers to address the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities”. This edition takes account of developments in thinking and practice which have taken place since 2001 and takes a more inclusive approach. This edition also sets out to improve the usability and adoption of the Guide itself. This Guide, like its predecessor, is intended to be part of the overall framework that standards bodies can use in their efforts to support the development of systems that suit the needs of diverse users.It is an important goal for the whole of society that all people, regardless of their age, size or ability, have access to the broadest range of systems. Issues of accessibility to and usability of systems have become more critical as the number of people (such as older persons, children, persons with reduced abilities and persons with disabilities) with diverse user accessibility needs has increased.\n\n\n\n"

Standards help to harmonize technical and other specifications of products and services making industry more efficient and removing barriers to trade.Standards are considered an essential component of the “quality infrastructure”, the system comprising organizations (public and private), policies, relevant legal and regulatory framework and practices which is needed to support and enhance the quality, safety, and sustainable soundness of goods, services and processes.Standards are developed by many bodies, at the national, regional and international levels. Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level. ISO and IEC, together with their national bodies, are responsible for fostering and ensuring coherence and coordination.The ISO and IEC system for standardization is based on collaboration agreements between ISO and IEC and an extensive array of collaboration agreements among regional, national and other standards bodies\n\n\n\n"

Asthe tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of measurement uncertaintybecomes  more  important  when  assessing  conformity  to  these  tolerances.   Measurement  uncertainty  plays  acentral role in quality assessment and quality standards.Measurement is present in almost every human activity, including but not limited to industrial,  commercial,scientific, healthcare, safety and environmental.  Measurement helps the decision process in all these activities.Measurement uncertainty enables users of a measured quantity value to make comparisons, in the context ofconformity assessment, to obtain the probability of making an incorrect decision based on the measurement,and to manage the consequential risks.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].

In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV.

This is achieved by advancing novel cryptographic technologies and improving strong authentication mechanisms.\n\n \n Summary\nWith increasing mobility and Internet usage, the demand for digital services increases and has reached critical and high assurance domains like e-Government, e-Health and e-Business. Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. In order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services. To empirically evaluate our work and to produce outputs of a high technical readiness we will consider use cases from all three domains mentioned above.\n\nThe project CREDENTIAL is scheduled for 36 months and the work plan is defined in accordance with the objectives of the project, and organised according to the expertise of the partners. The work plan is organised in seven work packages and their relation and interdependencies is shown in the figure.\n\nThe CREDENTIAL consortium is composed of a balanced team of 5 industry partners, 2 applied research organisations, an SMEs and 3 universities, which are complementary in their expertise and have strong experience in their respective fields, i.e. identify and access management, cloud computing, information security and usability aspects.

As the EIS develops, the increasingly digital representation of personal characteristics changes our ways of identifying individuals, and supplementary digital identities, so-called virtual identities, embodying concepts such as pseudonymity and anonymity, are being created for security, profit, convenience or even for fun. These new identities are feeding back into the world of social and business affairs, offering a mix of plural identities and challenging traditional notions of identity. At the same time, European states manage identities in very different ways. For example, in Germany holding an ID card is mandatory for every adult, while in the UK state-issued ID cards do not exist. FIDIS objectives are shaping the requirements for the future management of identity in the EIS and contributing to the technologies and infrastructures needed.\n\nAs a multidisciplinary and multinational NoE FIDIS, appropriately, comprises different country research experiences with heterogeneous focuses, and integrates European expertise around a common set of activities. Additionally, all relevant stakeholders are addressed to ensure that the requirements are considered from different levels. FIDIS overcomes the extreme fragmentation of research into the future of identity by consolidating and fostering joint research in this area. Research results will be made accessible to European citizens, researchers and in particular to SMEs.

Users will benefit from the availability of a ubiquitously usable open source eID client that is capable of running on arbitrary desktop PCs, tablets and modern smart phones. FutureID will allow application and service providers to easily integrate their existing services with the FutureID infrastructure, providing them with the benefits from the strong security offered by eIDs without requiring them to make substantial investments. This will enable service providers to offer this technology to users as an alternative to username/password based systems, providing them with a choice for a more trustworthy, usable and innovative technology.\n\nFor existing and emerging trust service providers and card issuers FutureID will provide an integrative framework, which eases using their authentication and signature related products across Europe and beyond. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed technologies and the feasibility of the overall approach FutureID will develop two pilot applications and is open for additional application services who want to use the innovative FutureID technology.\n\n\n\n"

It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being.

But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "Technology can often do more harm than good in humanitarian situations. In an op-ed for The New York Times, Research Lead Mark Latonero argues against surveillance humanitarianism.\n\n    “Despite the best intentions, the decision to deploy technology like biometrics is built on a number of unproven assumptions, such as, technology solutions can fix deeply embedded political problems. And that auditing for fraud requires entire populations to be tracked using their personal data. And that experimental technologies will work as planned in a chaotic conflict setting. And last, that the ethics of consent don’t apply for people who are starving.”\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

It’s potentially very important work, and while some other projects (and Google) are working with law enforcement on similar efforts, Latonero’s group isn’t. This is partially due to the fact that universities typically like to stick to research rather than implementation, but one could also foresee some serious legal challenges to investigations based on data mining rather than evidence or specific complaints.”\n\nDerrick Harris, Why big data has some big problems when it comes to public policy, GigaOm, August 28, 2014\n\n\n\n"

Entities are expected to cover their own operational and development related costs. Result of the first phase will mature eventually with a production ledger for commercial use, potentially with a different name.\n\n\n\n"

It has two purposes:\n\n    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.\n    To encourage and conduct research on VRM-related theories, usage of VRM tools, and effects as adoption of VRM tools takes place.\n\nThe project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center). That promise was embodied in this statement, written by Christopher Locke:\n\n\n\n"

We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

Mr Anderson was not required, in his words, to “opine” on what safeguards would be appropriate or if the proposed safeguards in the Bill are proportionate. Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases. The Report also presented 69 case studies where powers have been used or, in the case of bulk equipment interference, examples of how the power would be used.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department.

This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

We were also a member of the open policy making group and the Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group, to which Dr Whitley referred to earlier.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you. I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

Our  thesis  is  that  blockchains,  or  more generically  distributed  ledgers,  are  a  potentially powerful new tool for “identity roots” — the starting points for an Internet identity. However “blockchain identity” may not fully address the core security and privacy  principles  needed  in  a  complete  identity system.

Pushing self-sovereign identity from the top-down is most likely to result in a technology that’s not actually used, but instead encouraging the average person to demand self-sovereign identity from the bottom-up will result in the organic development of a vibrant, well-utilized decentralized web-of-trust ecosystem.This paper addresses that need by ofering arguments to a variety of people who might be reluctant to use self-sovereign identity, uninterested in its possibilities, or oblivious to the dangers of centralization. By focusing on theneeds of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfll their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality\n\n\n\n"

This paper describes a possible alternate approach called decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI), which returns control of online identities to the entities they belong to. By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates. In usage, it can help “Johnny” to finally encrypt thanks to its relegation of public key management to secure decentralized datastores. Finally, it includes mechanisms to recover lost or compromised identifiers.\n\n\n\n"

          "description": "In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals —from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.\n\n\n\n"

Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept.To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.\n\n\n\n"

Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.\n\n\n\n"

Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifer) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a frst order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery.

Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email2, but there are many opportunities to go further.By attaching public keys to the profles of actors (users) on the network and using Linked Data Signatures, we can add a web of trust to the federated social web and use it to enhance user privacy and to assert the integrity ofmessages sent over the network.By using a decentralized identifer system such as Decentralized Identifers (DIDs) we can move fully from a decentralized to a distributed system3, by escaping the core centralization mechanisms of DNS and SSL certifcate authorities.At this point, users could even optionally transition from a client-server model system to a fully peer-to-peer system\n\n\n\n"

Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk.

New    technology    and    automated    systems,    encompassing    artificial intelligence, machine learningand big data analyticsare being used ever more widely in the criminal  justice  system.  These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice.

Clearly this is an issue and law enforcement has tobe able to respond effectively. Key to helping the police deal with the risingnumber ofconcerns is the idea of registering drones. Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners. Whatever system is introduced has to inspire confidence in both members of the public and users, be sensible, easyto administerand easy to promote.\n\n\n\n"

Biometrics now extends to but is not limited to DNA, facial search, gait, iris recognition, speech recognition, facial recognition. While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner. However, the scope of the Biometrics Commissioner is too narrow.

Who decides who decides?\" However,even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years, bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any functional domain.A RWOT6 paper explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general implications of introducing a credential holder into existing issuer/verifer relationships? Our analysis leads to cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder (the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifers already exist.

The Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Wien), the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien) and OwnYourData are the project  partners in this project which is funded by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG). Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails. Consequently, European policy makers have passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has imposed stricter regulations on personal data handling practices within the EU.\n\n\n\n"

We believe in a world where private data are protected from unjustified access and where people are truly aware of the privacy-related ramifications of using different devices or digital services. To realize this vision: we propose a crowdsourcing solution that will harness the power of the masses to improve the awareness of people on the content of Terms and Conditions: as well as to explicate the community’s related expectations: thereby exerting pressure on developers in supporting such expectations.\n\n\n\n"

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Mudge has had a long career of doing just that (legally, and for research purposes), so he's developed his own personal toolkit of measurements to take when assessing software risk.

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

Unfortunately: processing these datasets is often tedious and cumbersome. Organizations follow distinctive practices for codifying datasets. Combining data from different sources requires mapping common entities (city: county: etc.) and resolving different types of keys/identifiers. This process is time consuming and can increase the likelihood for methodological errors.\n\nData Commons attempts to synthesize a single \"Open Knowledge Graph\" (OKG) from these different data sources. It links references to the same entities (such as cities: counties: organizations: etc.) across different datasets to nodes on the graph: so that users can access data about a particular entity aggregated from different sources without data cleaning or joining. Like the Web: the Data Commons OKG is open - any user can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the graph. In the long term: we hope the data contained within the Data Commons OKG will be useful to students: researchers: and enthusiasts across different disciplines. Though we've \"jump-started\" the graph with data from publicly available sources (CDC: US Census: FBI: etc.): we encourage you to join and contribute.\n\nYou can use the Data Commons Graph Browser to browse the graph. The data can be programmatically accessed via APIs. For example usage: check out the tutorials.\n\nData Commons is a project started by Google: and is intended to be a community effort.

Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center).

Here is a short description of the project:\n\nIn our increasingly digital societies, data is perceived as a key resource for economic growth. Among the highest-valued corporations today, many have business models that are essentially based on data of or about their users. This development has raised serious concerns about individuals’ right to privacy and their ability to exercise control over their own data, as well as about the broader shifts of power between data subjects and data controllers that this development entails.

We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

Customer Commons also holds that an individual must be able to proffer his or her own terms of engagement, in ways that are practical and easy to understand by both sides—and to agree to, in ways that can be visited and audited later.\n\nCustomer Commons believes free customers are more valuable than captive ones—to themselves, to the companies they deal with, and to the whole economy.\n\n\n\n"

Through a consensus driven multi-stakeholder process, criteria have been identified for connected home, office and wearable technologies including toys, activity trackers and fitness devices. The Framework outlines the need for comprehensive disclosures which need to be provided prior to product purchase, policies regarding data collection, usage and sharing, as well as the terms and conditions of security patching post-warranty. Security updates are essential to maximize the protection of IoT devices when vulnerabilities are discovered and attacks evolve. In addition, the Framework provides recommendations for manufacturers to enhance transparency and communication regarding devices’ ability to be updated and a range of data privacy related issues.\n\nCore to addressing the inherent security risks and privacy issues is the application of the principles to the entire device solution or ecosystem. These include the device or sensor, the supporting applications, and the backend / cloud services. As many products coming to market rely on third-party or open source components and software, it is incumbent on developers to apply these principles and conduct supply chain security and privacy risk assessments.\n\nServing as a risk assessment guide for developers, purchasers and retailers, the Framework is the foundation for future IoT certification programs. It is the goal of OTA to highlight devices which meet these standards to help consumers, as well as the public and private sectors, make informed purchasing decisions. The Framework and related resources are available at https://otalliance.org/IoT.\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

As do other users, SMEs benefit from the technical expertise of standards in the elaboration of which they may not have been present. Nevertheless, there are also sometimes advantages to being small as they can adapt quickly, can be more flexible and can have smaller overhead.Furthermore, if standards were to take into consideration the SME perspective, considerable benefits would accrue to all the stakeholders involved in standardization.The aim of this Guide is to raise awareness on the issues that may be of importance to SMEs.

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

Alongside the growth of international trade, technological and societal cooperation, standards bodies have developed procedures and modes of cooperation which are commonly considered to constitute good practices for standards development at all levels. The use of standards is voluntary unless they are cited as requirements in legislation or in legal contracts.The foundations of ISO’s and IEC’s membership and participation models are at the national level.

Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.

ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5).

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993.

In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.

We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

The second, thirdandfourth editions of ISO Guide 2 added new terms and definitions in more or less isolated groups, within no overall planned framework. Work on a systematically structured revision was authorized by the ISO Council in 1981 as the principal task of a working group within the ISO Committee on standardization principles (ISO/STACO), including IEC and UN/ECE spokesmen and in cooperation with the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (ISO/CASCO) and the International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC). The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.  Moreover,  ISO  was  publishing  an  increasing  number  of  Guides  on  standardization  policies  and  procedures, several of them in conjunction with IEC.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

The  quantities  involved  might  be  real  or  complex.   Two  approaches  areconsidered for treating such models.  The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty framework.The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation of distributions.  Appropriateuse of the Monte Carlo method would be expected to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUMuncertainty framework is questionable.The approach based on the GUM uncertainty framework is applicable when the input quantities are summarized(as in the GUM) in terms of estimates (for instance, measured values) and standard uncertainties associatedwith  these  estimates  and,  when  appropriate,  covariances  associated  with  pairs  of  these  estimates.   Formulæand procedures are provided for obtaining estimates of the output quantities and for evaluating the associatedstandard uncertainties and covariances.  Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry.

Instead, parents turn to Google, school websites, and independent school review sites, such as InsideSchools and GreatSchools. Furthermore, the authors find that the information sources that parents favor (InsideSchools and GreatSchools over DOE dashboards) “digest” the data in a way that reinforces the correlation between poverty, minority populations, and low test scores.\n\n\n\n"

However, Caplan and co-writer Philip M. Napoli assert that this argument has led to a misclassification of these companies and such misclassification has profound policy implications.\n\n    A common position amongst online content providers/aggregators is their resistance to being characterized as media companies. Companies such as Google, Facebook, BuzzFeed, and Twitter have argued that it is inaccurate to think of them as media companies. Rather, they argue that they should be thought of as technology companies. The logic of this position, and its implications for communications policy, have yet to be thoroughly analyzed. However, such an analysis is increasingly necessary as the dynamics of news and information production, dissemination, and consumption continue to evolve. This paper will explore and critique the logic and motivations behind the position that these content providers/aggregators are technology companies rather than media companies, as well as the communications policy implications associated with accepting or rejecting this position.\n\n\n\n"

He argues that information algorithms like the ones used to identify “trends” on Facebook do not work alone and cannot work alone and argues that “in so many ways that we must simply discard the fantasy that they do, or ever will.”\n\n    People are in the algorithm because how could they not be? People produce the Facebook activity being measured, people design the algorithms and set their evaluative criteria, people decide what counts as a trend, people name and summarize them, and people look to game the algorithm with their next posts.\n\n    Trending algorithms are undeniably becoming part of the cultural landscape, and revelations like Gizmodo’s are helpful steps in helping us shed the easy notions of what they are and how they work, notions the platforms have fostered. Social media platforms must come to fully realize that they are newsmakers and gatekeepers, whether they intend to be or not, whether they want to be or not. And while algorithms can chew on a lot of data, it is still a substantial, significant, and human process to turn that data into claims about importance that get fed back to millions of users. This is not a realization that they will ever reach on their own — which suggests to me that they need the two countervailing forces that journalism has: a structural commitment to the public, imposed if not inherent, and competition to force them to take such obligations seriously.\n\n\n\n"

The fervor over inBloom showed that policies and procedures were not yet where they needed to be for schools to engage in data-informed instruction.

In short, accountability of what, to whom, for what ends, at what cost?\n\nAbstract:\n\n    There is an ongoing tension in the American public education system between the values of excellence, equity, and a sustained commitment to efficiency. Accountability has emerged as a framework in education reform that promises to promote and balance all three values. Yet, this frame is often contested due to disagreements over the role of incentives and penalties in achieving desirable change, and concerns that the proposed mechanisms will have significant unintended consequences that outweigh potential benefits. More fundamentally, there is widespread disagreement over how to quantify excellence and equity, if it is even possible to do so. Accountability rhetoric echoes a broader turn toward data-driven decision-making and resource allocation across sectors. As a tool of power, accountability processes shift authority and control away from professional educators and toward policymakers, bureaucrats, and test makers.\n\n\n\n"

They also investigate the extent to which these patterns vary between industrialised and developing countries.\n\n    Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer the possibility of entirely virtual learning environments, with lectures, discussions, and assignments all distributed via the internet. The virtual nature of MOOCs presents considerable advantages to students in terms of flexibility to learn what they want, when they want. Yet despite their virtual focus, some MOOC users also seek to create face-to-face communities with students taking similar courses or using similar platforms. This paper aims to assess the learner motivations behind creation of these offline communities. Do these face-to-face meetings represent an added extra to the learning experience, with students taking advantage of the context of the MOOCs to create new personal and professional connections? Or, are offline meetups filling a gap for students who feel that not all learning can take place online? We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary between developing and industrialised regions, thus testing the claim that MOOCs are helping to democratise access to education around the world. Our research is based on a unique source of socially generated big data, drawn from the website ‘meetup.com’, which gives us a data set of over 4000 MOOC related events taking place in over 140 countries around the world over a two year period. We apply a mixed methods approach to this data, combining large-scale analysis with more in-depth thematic hand coding, to more fully explore the reasons why some learners add a ‘real’ component to their virtual learning experience.\n\n\n\n"

Such “neutral” systems are supposedly good for implementing legal logic because, like these systems, law relies on binaries in decision-making, removing the gray and fuzzy from the equation. The problem with this formulation is that efficiency is not necessarily desirable, bias is baked into the data sets and reified technically as well as through interpretation, and legal binaries are neither socially productive nor logically sound.\n\nD&S founder danah boyd responds to Margaret Hu’s work in Big Data Blacklisting with supportive arguments that further Hu’s assertions. boyd discusses how procedure and efficiency make algorithmic decision-making so attractive to policymakers and bureaucrats yet flawed systems in place do not make data neutral and in fact ‘blacklists purposefully distance decision-makers from the humanity of those who are being labeled’.\n\n\n\n"

However, children’s own transgressive behaviour can test the boundaries of this protection regime, creating new dilemmas for lawmakers the world over. This article examines the policy response from both the Global North and South to young people’s online behaviour that may challenge adult conceptions of what is acceptable, within existing legal and policy frameworks. It asks whether the ‘childhood innocence’ implied in much protection discourse is a helpful basis for promoting children’s rights in the digital age. Based on a comparative analysis of the emerging policy trends in Europe, South Africa and the United States, the article assesses the implications for policymakers and child welfare specialists as they attempt to redraw the balance between children’s online safety while supporting their agency as digital citizens.\n\n\n\n"

It’s dangerous that we think that basic research starts with the questions we find important rather than trying to understand the knowledge that society is missing. Peer review suggests that we are the only ones who have purchase over whether a study is valuable enough to fund or publish.

Power users typically show high levels of activity from the beginning of their participation [13]; though studies have also suggested that power users can also learn as they develop [14]. Does the same hold true for online education? 2) Are power learners crucial for starting and maintaining online education communities? In other contexts, such as Wikipedia editing, active early involvement of a small mass of committed participants is crucial for starting collective activities [8]. Is this also the case when it comes to online education?\n\n\n\n"

Research done in part with collaboration from Brooklyn Public Library found that frontline library staff required training and ongoing support to better respond to patron needs regarding digital privacy or data profiling issues.1 The Data Privacy Project aims to meet that need. With additional training and easy step- by-step resource guides and straightforward training materials, we believe that libraries will be more likely to live up to their professional commitment to protecting patron privacy.\n\n    As the Internet and its usage continue to influence and shape our lives, the issues of digital privacy and data profiling are central to policymaking and public debate.

We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

Along with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the Data Protection Bill (DP Bill) is the biggest shake up of Data Protection law in the UK since 1998.In  the  UK  our  data  protection  laws currently rely on one  document  The  Data Protection  Act 1998. The Act is  a  reasonably  short  document  which  clearly  spells  out  right  from  the  start  what  a  person’s data protection rights are.The  new  dual  laws  of  the  GDPR  and  the  DP  Bill  are  welcome  in  that  they  expand  and  clarify  data protection for the 21stCentury, but  by introducing two separate pieces  of law there  is the opportunity for confusion for the public to know what their rights are, when they can be used and how. This briefing outlines the difference between the GDPR and the DP Bill and outlines the welcome aspects of the DP Bill for the public and areas of concern which Parliament should look to query and address.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department. However, it is this database with which facial recognition technology is used by police.\n\n\n\n"

Wewelcome   the   opportunity   to   provide   briefing   ahead   of   this   debate   and   seek   to   informparliamentarians of the significant risks live facial recognition surveillance poses to humanrights and the rule of law in the UK.A   threat   to   freedom:   The   emergence   of   live   facial   recognition   surveillance   bypolice   in   England   and   Wales   poses  one   of   the   most   serious   threats   to   civilliberties   of   recent   years.   This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather. Secondly,   we   raise   the   issue   that  the   custody   image   database   contains   hundreds   ofthousands of innocent people’s images, likely unlawfully.\n\n\n\n"

I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.\n\n\n\n"

These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice. The protections afforded to individuals subject  to  these  biased,  unfair  or  unjust decisions  are  minimal.  Many  will  never  even  be aware they have been subject to such an automated decision.\n\n\n\n"

Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners.

Furthermore, these regimes prescribe that companies will not use data for purposes other than the purposes for which they were collected, called use limitation, except for legal purposes and when the user provides consent. To help companies write better privacy requirements that embody the use limitations and collection limitation principles, we conducted a case study to identify how purpose is expressed among five privacy policies from the shopping domain. Using content analysis, we discovered six exclusive data purpose categories. In addition, we observed natural language patterns to express purpose. Finally, we found that data purpose specificity varies with the specificity of information type descriptions.

At the same time, media coverage of ways that APIs have been misused has sparked concern for potential privacy invasions and other issues of public policy. This paper seeks to educate consumers on how APIs work and how they are used within popular websites and mobile apps to gather, share, and utilize data.APIs are used in mobile games, search engines, social media platforms, news and shopping websites, video and music streaming services, dating apps, and mobile payment systems. If a third-party company, like an app developer or advertiser, would like to gain access to your information through a website you visit or a mobile app or online service you use, what data might they obtain about you through APIs and how? This report analyzes 11 prominent online services to observe general trends and provide you an overview of the role APIs play in collecting and distributing information about consumers. For example, how might your data be gathered and shared when using your Facebook account login to sign up for Venmo or to access the Tinder dating app? How might advertisers use Pandora’s API when you are streaming music?\n\n\n\n"

However, users rarely read them and struggle to understand their con-tents. Also, the entities that provide these policies are sometimes unmotivated to make them com-prehensible.  Recently, annotated corpora of privacy policies have been introduced to the researchcommunity.   They open the door to the development of machine learning and natural languageprocessing techniques to automate the annotation of these documents.  In turn, these annotationscan be passed on to interfaces (e.g., web browser plugins) that help users quickly identify and un-derstand relevant privacy statements. We present advances in extracting privacy policy paragraphs(termedsegmentsin this paper) and individual sentences that relate to expert-identified categoriesof policy contents, using methods in supervised learning. In particular, we show that relevant seg-ments and sentences can be classified with average micro-F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.66 respectively,improving over prior work.  We discuss how the techniques introduced in this paper have beenused to automatically annotate the text of about 7,000 privacy policies.

To study this problem, we investigated an approach to automatically construct an information type ontology by identifying information type hyponymy in privacy policies using Tregex patterns. Tregex is a utility to match regular expressions against constituency parse trees, which are hierarchical expressions of natural language clauses, including noun and verb phrases. We discovered the Tregex patterns by applying content analysis to 30 privacy policies from six domains (shopping, telecommunication, social networks, employment, health, and news.) From this dataset, three semantic and four lexical categories of hyponymy emerged based on category completeness and word-order. Among these, we identified and empirically evaluated 72 Tregex patterns to automate the extraction of hyponyms from privacy policies.

While research shows that Internet userscare about their privacy, they do not have the time to understand the policies of every website they visit,and most users hardly ever read privacy policies. Some recent efforts have aimed to use a combination ofcrowdsourcing, machine learning, and natural language processing to interpret privacy policies at scale, thusproducing annotations for use in interfaces that inform Internet users of salient policy details. However,little attention has been devoted to studying the accuracy of crowdsourced privacy policy annotations, howcrowdworker productivity can be enhanced for such a task, and the levels of granularity that are feasible forautomatic analysis of privacy policies. In this article, we present a trajectory of work addressing each of thesetopics. We include analyses of crowdworker performance, evaluation of a method to make a privacy-policyoriented task easier for crowdworkers, a coarse-grained approach to labeling segments of policy text withdescriptive themes, and a fine-grained approach to identifying user choices described in policy text. Together,the results from these efforts show the effectiveness of using automated and semi-automated methods forextracting from privacy policies the data practice details that are salient to Internet users’ interests\n\n\n\n"

Research has shownthat few users take the time to read these policies, as they areoften long and difficult to understand. In addition, users oftenonly care about a small subset of issues discussed in privacypolicies, and some of the issues they actually care about maynot even be addressed in the text of the policies. Rather thanrequiring users to read the policies, a better approach might beto allow them to simply ask questions about those issues theycare about, possibly through iterative dialog. In this work, wetake a step towards this goal by exploring the idea of an au-tomated privacy question-answering assistant, and look at thekinds of questions users are likely to pose to such a system.This analysis is informed by an initial study that elicits pri-vacy questions from crowdworkers about the data practicesof mobile apps.

The length of these policiesand their often convoluted language have been shown to discourage most users fromreading them.  Recent progress in natural language processing and machine learninghas opened the door to the development of technologies that are capable of automati-cally extracting statements (or “annotations”) from the text of privacy policies.  Thesetechnologies could help users quickly identify those elements of a privacy notice theycare about - without requiring them to read the full text of the notice.In  this  article,  we  review  the  requirements  associated  with  the  development  ofQuery Answering functionality that would enable users to ask questions about spe-cific aspects of privacy notices (e.g. Does this app share my location with third parties?Am I able to review the information this website collects about me?  Can I delete myaccount?   For how long is my information going to be retained by this company?).We  discuss  different  possible  approaches  to  supporting  such  functionality  and  howthey relate to recent advances in automatically annotating privacy notices.

In particular, in con-trast to automated annotation techniques that aim to extract detailed statements fromthe text of privacy notices, Query Answering functionality could be configured to re-turn short text fragments extracted from privacy notices and rely on the user (ratherthan the computer) to interpret some of the finer nuances of the text found in thesefragments. Such an approach could potentially prove more robust than fully automatedannotation techniques,  which at least at this time struggle with the interpretation offiner nuances.\n\n\n\n"

Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose an automated framework for privacy policy analysis (Polisis). It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on natural language privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural-network classifiers that accounts for both high-level aspects and fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis' modularity and utility with two applications supporting structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task. The second application, PriBot, is the first freeform question-answering system for privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions. Using an MTurk user study with 700 participants, we show that at least one of PriBot's top-3 answers is relevant to users for 89% of the test questions.\n\n\n\n"

              "description": "Semantic Web, 9, 2, Jan 2018\n\nPrivacy policies are intended to inform users about the collection and use of their data by websites, mobile apps and other services or appliances they interact with. This also includes informing users about any choices they might have regarding such data practices. However, few users read these often long privacy policies; and those who do have difficulty understanding them, because they are written in convoluted and ambiguous language. A promising approach to help overcome this situation revolves around semi-automatically annotating policies, using combinations of crowdsourcing, machine learning and natural language processing. In this article, we introduce PrivOnto, a semantic framework to represent annotated privacy policies. PrivOnto relies on an ontology developed to represent issues identified as critical to users and/or legal experts. PrivOnto has been used to analyze a corpus of over 23,000 annotated data practices, extracted from 115 privacy policies of US-based companies. We introduce a collection of 57 SPARQL queries to extract information from the PrivOnto knowledge base, with the dual objective of (1) answering privacy questions of interest to users and (2) supporting researchers and regulators in the analysis of privacy policies at scale. We present an interactive online tool using PrivOnto to help users explore our corpus of 23,000 annotated data practices. Finally, we outline future research and open challenges in using semantic technologies for privacy policy analysis.\n\n\n\n"

Privacy policies, however, remain long, complex, and impractical for consumers. Communicating in some short-hand form, synthesized privacy content is now crucial to empower internet users and provide them more meaningful notice, as well as nudge consumers and data processors toward more meaningful privacy. Indeed, on the basis of these needs, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as lawmakers and policymakers in the European Union, have advocated for the development of privacy indicator systems.\n\n\n\n"

Since consent is deemed necessary and part of a social contract for fairness, however, without meaningful consent, that social contract is effectively broken and the best intent of our laws undermined.\n\nOur research challenges to address this gap are interdisciplinary: meaningful consent has implications for transforming current digital economy data practices; change will require potentially new business models, and certainly new forms of interaction to highlight policy without over burdening citizens as we go about our business. We have set out a vision to achieve an understanding of meaningful consent through a combination of interdisciplinary expert and citizen activities to deliver useful policy, business and technology guidelines.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

We outline this mismatch with five “traps” that fair-ML work can fall into even as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions, and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors rather than purely technical ones.”\n\n\n\n"

We call this dynamic refractive surveillance. In other words, collecting information about one group can facilitate control over an entirely different group.

He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities.

A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

These  impacts  range  from  slight  to  significant;  they  can  be  short-term  or  long-term;  and  they  occur  at  global,  regional  or  local  level.  Provisions  in  product  standards  have  an  influence  on  environmental  impacts of products. The  need  to  reduce  the  potential  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment  of  a  product  that  can  occur  during  all  stages  of  its  life  is  recognized  around  the  world.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  products  can  be  reduced by taking into account environmental issues in product standards. This Guide is intended for use by all those involved in the drafting of product standards, to draw attention to environmental  issues  in  support  of  sustainable  international  trade,  and  is  not  intended  to  be  used  to  create  non-tariff barriers to trade. Standards writers are not expected to become environmental experts but, by using this Guide, they are encouraged to: ⎯    identify   and   understand   basic   environmental   aspects   and   impacts   related   to   the   product   under   consideration, and ⎯    determine  when  it  is  possible  and  when  it  is  not  possible  to  deal  with  an  environmental  issue  through  a  product standard. During  the  life-cycle  of  a  given  product,  different  environmental  aspects  can  be  determined.  However,  the  identification  of  these  aspects  and  the  prediction  of  their  impacts  is  a  complex  process.  When  writing  a  product standard, it is important to ensure that an evaluation as to how products can affect the environment at different stages of their life-cycle is carried out as early as possible in the process of developing the standard. The results of this evaluation are important for specifying provisions in standards. It is anticipated that product standards  writers  actively  consider  compliance  with  any  applicable  national,  regional  or  local  product  related  regulation.\n\n\n\n"

The main reason for this activity was a request from UN/ECE for complete and urgent revision of ISO Guide 2 to take into account a number of specific problems raised by the UN/ECE Government Officials Responsible for Standardization Policies as well as the proposed terminology being prepared in the UN/ECE Working Party on  Building.

This document is based on risk management principles and ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014 to address the needs of the medical device sector.The concept of safety, as described in this document, is closely related to protecting patients who are the subjects of medical care, as well as those persons who provide the care and other potentially affected persons. Safety is also related to harm to property or the environment.The approach described in this document aims to reduce the risk arising during the life cycle of a medical device, including design, production, distribution, installation, use, service, maintenance, and destruction or disposal. The complete life cycle of a medical device (including both the intended use and the reasonably foreseeable misuse) is considered. The goal is to achieve acceptable risk for people, property and the environment.As different circumstances warrant different approaches to ensuring safety, it is impossible to provide precise requirements and recommendations that apply to every case. Examples of such differences are the development of standards for manufacturers of medical devices and standards for health care providers and institutions. However, this document, when followed on a judicious “use when applicable” basis, will help in developing standards that include aspects of safety which are consistent with the generally acknowledged state of the art.NOTE The term “standard” used throughout this document includes International Standards, Technical Specifications, Publicly Available Specifications, Technical Reports and Guides developed by ISO or IEC.\n\n\n\n"

Variants of the formulæ and procedures relate to models for which theoutput quantities (a) can be expressed directly in terms of the input quantities as measurement functions, and(b) are obtained through solving a measurement model, which links implicitly the input and output quantities.The  counterparts  of  the  formulæ  in  the  GUM  for  the  standard  uncertainty  associated  with  an  estimate  ofthe output quantity would be algebraically cumbersome.  Such formulæ are provided in a more compact formin  terms  of  matrices  and  vectors,  the  elements  of  which  contain  variances  (squared  standard  uncertainties),covariances and sensitivity coefficients.  An advantage of this form of presentation is that these formulæ canreadily be implemented in the many computer languages and systems that support matrix algebra.\n\n\n\n"

              "description": "Uncertainty of measurement -- Part 4, Role of measurement uncertainty in conformity assessment\n\nConformity assessment(see 3.3.1), as broadly defined, is any activity undertaken to determine, directly or indirectly,whether a product, process, system, person or body meets relevant standards and fulfillsspecified  requirements(see3.3.3).   ISO/IEC  17000:2004  gives  general  terms  and  definitions  relating  to  conformity  assessment,  including  theaccreditation of conformity assessment bodies and the use of conformity assessment in facilitating trade.In a particular kind of conformity assessment, sometimes calledinspection(see 3.3.2), the determination that a productfulfils a specified requirement relies on measurement as a principal source of information.  ISO 10576-1:2003 [22] setsout guidelines for checking conformity with specified limits in the case where aquantity(see 3.2.1) is measured and aresultingcoverage interval(see 3.2.7) (termed ‘uncertainty interval’ in ISO 10576-1:2003) is compared with atoleranceinterval(see 3.3.5). The present document extends this approach to include explicit consideration of risks, and developsgeneral procedures for deciding conformity based onmeasurement  results(see 3.2.5), recognizing the central role ofprobability distributions(see 3.1.1) as expressions of uncertainty and incomplete information.The evaluation of measurement uncertainty is a technical problem whose solution is addressed by JCGM 100:2008,theGuide  to  the  expression  of  uncertainty  in  measurement(GUM), and by and its Supplements,  JCGM 101:2008,JCGM 102:2011 and JCGM 103 [3].  The present document assumes that a quantity of interest, themeasurand(see3.2.4), has been measured, with the result of the measurement expressed in a manner compatible with the principlesdescribed in the GUM. In particular, it is assumed that corrections have been applied to account for all recognizedsignificant systematic effects.\n\n\n\n"

              "description": "International vocabulary of metrology -- Basic and general conceptsand associated terms (VIM)\n\nIn general, a vocabulary is a “terminological dictionary which contains designations and definitions from one or more  specific  subject  fields”  (ISO  1087-1:2000,  3.7.2).  The  present  Vocabulary  pertains  to  metrology,  the  “science  of  measurement  and  its  application”.  It  also  covers  the  basic  principles  governing  quantities  and  units. The field of quantities and units could be treated in many different ways. Clause 1 of this Vocabulary is one  such  treatment,  and  is  based  on  the  principles  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  ISO  31,  Quantities  and  units,  currently  being  replaced  by  ISO  80000  and  IEC  80000  series  Quantities  and  units,  and  in  the  SI Brochure, The International System of Units (published by the BIPM). The  second  edition  of  the  International  vocabulary  of  basic  and  general  terms  in  metrology  (VIM)  was  published in 1993. The need to cover measurements in chemistry and laboratory medicine for the first time, as well  as  to  incorporate  concepts  such  as  those  that  relate  to  metrological  traceability,  measurement  uncertainty,  and  nominal  properties,  led  to  this  third  edition.  Its  title  is  now  International  vocabulary  of  metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM),in order to emphasize the primary role of concepts in developing a vocabulary. In  this  Vocabulary,  it  is  taken  for  granted  that  there  is  no  fundamental  difference  in  the  basic  principles  of  measurement  in  physics,  chemistry,  laboratory  medicine,  biology,  or  engineering.  Furthermore,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  meet  conceptual  needs  of  measurement  in  fields  such  as  biochemistry,  food  science,  forensic science, and molecular biology. Several  concepts  that  appeared  in  the  second  edition  of  the  VIM  do  not  appear  in  this  third  edition  because  they  are  no  longer  considered  to  be  basic  or  general.  For  example,  the  concept  'response  time',  used  in  describing  the  temporal  behaviour  of  a  measuring  system,  is  not  included.  For  concepts  related  to  measurement  devices  that  are  not  covered  by  this  third  edition  of  the  VIM,  the  reader  should  consult  other  vocabularies such as IEC 60050, International Electrotechnical Vocabulary, IEV. For concepts concerned with quality management, mutual recognition arrangements pertaining to metrology, or legal metrology, the reader is referred to documents given in the bibliography.\n\n\n\n"

The  treatment  applies  to  a  model  having  any  number  of  input  quantities, and a single output quantity. The   described   Monte   Carlo   method   is   a   practical   alternative   to   the   GUM   uncertainty   framework   [ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008, 3.4.8]. It has value when a)    linearization of the model provides an inadequate representation or b)    the  probability  density  function  (PDF)  for  the  output  quantity  departs  appreciably  from  a  Gaussian  distribution or a scaled and shifted t-distribution, e.g. due to marked asymmetry. In case a), the estimate of the output quantity and the associated standard uncertainty provided by the GUM uncertainty  framework  might  be  unreliable.  In  case  b),  unrealistic  coverage  intervals  (a  generalization  of  “expanded uncertainty” in the GUM uncertainty framework) might be the outcome.\n\n\n\n"

However, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain or to increase this standard even further, given the great challenges and current threats Europe is facing. Upholding and restoring the necessary level of safety and security we are accustomed to requires the development and implementation of innovative technical solutions such as intelligent sensing systems and sensor networks. These hold the promise that hazards and threats can be detected early enough to avoid severe adverse impact, while still allowing people to travel and move freely as well as maintaining free trade and circulation of goods.\n\nAt the same time, smart factories and intelligent logistics based on cyber-physical systems and the internet of things (IoT), also referred to as Industry 4.0, pose new challenges with respect to operational safety. Advanced sensors and sensor networks are required e.g. for the safe operation of autonomous mobile systems.  \n\nTo provide valid solutions to all these challenges, a cross-disciplinary collaboration of researchers from natural sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences is required. To foster the communication and interaction among these different communities on this very topic, the »Future Security« conference series provides an interdisciplinary exchange platform for scientists, experts and actors from research, industry, public bodies and authorities. This conference provides direct insight into current security research activities and hot topics in this field.    \n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the 11th »Future Security« Conference.\n\n\n\n"

This is achieved by advancing novel cryptographic technologies and improving strong authentication mechanisms.\n\n \n Summary\nWith increasing mobility and Internet usage, the demand for digital services increases and has reached critical and high assurance domains like e-Government, e-Health and e-Business. Those domains have high security and privacy requirements and hence will be harnessed with various novel mechanisms for secure access. Approaches for handling the resulting variety of authentication and authorisation mechanisms include the use of digital identity and access management systems (IAM). Like other technologies IAMs follow the trend of using cloud services. This allows abstracting over used resources and enables ubiquitous access to identity data which is stored and processed in the cloud, but also results in an additional degree of complexity for securely operating IAMs. The goal of CREDENTIAL is to develop, test and showcase innovative cloud based services for storing, managing, and sharing digital identity information and other critical personal data. The security of these services relies on the combination of strong hardware-based multi-factor authentication with end-to-end encryption representing a significant advantage over current password-based authentication schemes. The use of sophisticated proxy cryptography schemes will enable a secure and privacy preserving information sharing network for cloud-based identity information in which even the identity provider cannot access the data in plain-text and hence protect access to identity data. We focus not only on evaluating and applying novel crypto-approaches for IAMs but also on implementing them in an easy-to-use way to motivate secure handling of identity data. In order to also address security, privacy and trust issues related to the used cloud platforms and services we will investigate assurance and resilience approaches for enhancing underlying cloud services. To empirically evaluate our work and to produce outputs of a high technical readiness we will consider use cases from all three domains mentioned above.\n\nThe project CREDENTIAL is scheduled for 36 months and the work plan is defined in accordance with the objectives of the project, and organised according to the expertise of the partners. The work plan is organised in seven work packages and their relation and interdependencies is shown in the figure.\n\nThe CREDENTIAL consortium is composed of a balanced team of 5 industry partners, 2 applied research organisations, an SMEs and 3 universities, which are complementary in their expertise and have strong experience in their respective fields, i.e. identify and access management, cloud computing, information security and usability aspects. The partners are from 7 different EU member states and they were carefully selected to cover the complete value chain from theory to practice to maximize the impact and exploitation potential.\n\n\n\n"

In time however, additional service providers will also become connected to the platform thereby increasing the number of cross-border services available to European users. \n\nThus in the future, you should be able to start a company, get your tax refund, or obtain your university papers without physical presence; all you will need to access these services is to enter your personal data using your national eID, and the STORK platform will obtain the required guarantee (authentication) from your government.\n\nUser-centric Approach = Privacy Guarantee\n\nThe role of the STORK platform is to identify a user who is in a session with a service provider, and to send his data to this service. Whilst the service provider may request various data items, the user always controls the data to be sent. The explicit consent of the owner of the data, the user, is always required before his data can be sent to the service provider.\n\nThe platform will not store any personal data, so no data can be lost.\n\nThis user centric approach was not taken to satisfy some philosophical preferences, but in line with the legislative requirements of all the various countries involved that oblige concrete measures to be taken to guarantee that a citizen's fundamental rights, such as his privacy, are respected.\n\n\n\n"

As the EIS develops, the increasingly digital representation of personal characteristics changes our ways of identifying individuals, and supplementary digital identities, so-called virtual identities, embodying concepts such as pseudonymity and anonymity, are being created for security, profit, convenience or even for fun. These new identities are feeding back into the world of social and business affairs, offering a mix of plural identities and challenging traditional notions of identity. At the same time, European states manage identities in very different ways. For example, in Germany holding an ID card is mandatory for every adult, while in the UK state-issued ID cards do not exist. FIDIS objectives are shaping the requirements for the future management of identity in the EIS and contributing to the technologies and infrastructures needed.\n\nAs a multidisciplinary and multinational NoE FIDIS, appropriately, comprises different country research experiences with heterogeneous focuses, and integrates European expertise around a common set of activities. Additionally, all relevant stakeholders are addressed to ensure that the requirements are considered from different levels. FIDIS overcomes the extreme fragmentation of research into the future of identity by consolidating and fostering joint research in this area. Research results will be made accessible to European citizens, researchers and in particular to SMEs.

He cautions developers and policymakers to consider the risks of failing to understand the unique challenges facing refugee children living without running water, let alone a good mobile network.\n\n    The reality is that no learning app or technology will improve education by itself. It’s also questionable whether mobile apps used with minimal adult supervision can improve a refugee child’s well-being. A roundtable at the Brookings Center for Universal Education noted that “children have needs that cannot be addressed where there is little or no human interaction. A teacher is more likely to note psychosocial needs and to support children’s recovery, or to refer children to other services when they are in greater contact with children.” Carleen Maitland, a technology and policy professor who led the Penn State team, found through her experience at Zaatari that in-person interactions with instructors and staff in the camp’s many community centers could provide far greater learning opportunities for young people than sitting alone with a mobile app.\n\n    In fact, unleashing ed tech vendors or Western technologists to solve development issues without the appropriate cultural awareness could do more harm than good. Children could come to depend on technologies that are abandoned by developers once the attention and funding have waned. Plus, the business models that sustain apps through advertising, or collecting and selling consumer data, are unethical where refugees are concerned. Ensuring data privacy and security for refugee children using apps should be a top priority for any software developer.\n\n    In cases where no in-person education is available, apps can still play a role, particularly for children who feel unsafe to travel outside their shelters or are immobile owing to injuries or disabilities. But if an app is to stand a chance of making a real difference, it needs to arise not out of a tech meet-up in New York City but on a field research trip to a refugee camp, where it will be easier to see how mobile phones are actually accessed and used. Researchers need to ask basic questions about the value of education for refugees: Is the goal to inspire learning on traditional subjects? Empower students with academic credentials or job skills? Assimilate refugees into their host country? Provide a protected space where children can be fed and feel safe? Or combat violent extremism at an early age?\n\n    To decide, researchers need to put the specific needs of refugee children first—whether economic, psychosocial, emotional, or physical—and work backward to see whether technology can help, if at all.\n\n\n\n"

A growing cohort of state, non-governmental, and corporate actors in the United States have come together around the shared contention that technology functions as both a facilitator and disrupting force of trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. Despite increased attention to the trafficking-technology nexus, scant research to date has critically unpacked these shifts nor mapped how technology reconfigures anti-trafficking collaborations. In this article, we propose that widespread anxieties and overzealous optimism about technology’s role in facilitating and disrupting trafficking have simultaneously promoted a tri-part anti-trafficking response, one animated by a law and order agenda, operationalized through augmented internet, mobile, and networked surveillance, and maintained through the integration of technology experts and advocates into organized anti-trafficking efforts. We suggest that an examination of technology has purchase for students of gender, sexuality, and neoliberal governmentality in its creation of new methods of surveillance, exclusion, and expertise.\n\n\n\n"

In the case of online child sexual exploitation, these assumptions are true, but limited. INTERPOL and the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) lead efforts to identify and take down CSAM images globally, a technological fix. Yet it is a finding of this study that combined with international response there is also a need for a local response to attend to the victims and perpetrators. Local response to online child sexual exploitation relies on the strength of the existing child protection system, locating treatment of abuse incidents regardless of where they occur, within an existing framework. It additionally addresses that a single child may be victim of multiple forms of abuse and seeking treatment from the same facilities.\n\n\n\n"

After hitting the #1 spot on the iTunes UK trending chart, ranking #4 in Lifestyle (just behind Tinder) and launching a co-branded version of their app with Teléfonica Deutschland, a waiting list was implemented and the team reverted back to stealth mode while focussing on Phase Two of their global vision.\n\nIn late 2018, a number of major announcements will be made that re-introduce people.io - as part of an ecosystem of data-centric products designed to empower people while solving some of the fundamental challenges faced by major corporates in their ability to compete with the major tech companies.\n\nTo-date, people.io has received investment from a number of Europe’s most successful entrepreneurs, including Thomas Höegh (Founder of Lovefilm, Arts Alliance and Growth Street) and Nick Robertson (Founder of ASOS) in addition to the Founders Factory and Wayra Deutschland.\n\n\n\n"

It has two purposes:\n\n    To encourage development of tools by which individuals can take control of their relationships with organizations — especially in commercial marketplaces.\n    To encourage and conduct research on VRM-related theories, usage of VRM tools, and effects as adoption of VRM tools takes place.\n\nThe project was created by Doc Searls when he became a fellow at the Center in 2006. Since then it has grown to play a driving role in many different development categories. (A partial and ever-changing list of those, and their occupants, is here.)\n\nVRM stands for Vendor Relationship Management, the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship Management, the $48 billion business by which companies attempt to relate to customers (for example through call centers).\n\nDoc sees VRM as “a way to fulfill one of the promises of The Cluetrain Manifiesto” — the widely-cited website and book written in 1999 by Doc and three other authors (one of which is David Weinberger, also of the Center). That promise was embodied in this statement, written by Christopher Locke:\n\n\n\n"

We have raised concern about bias, assumptionsand the potential for negative or restrictive conclusions being drawn,which could cause individuals harm. Algorithms, the toolsused to analyse big data,are clearly part of this concern. 2.Firstly,not all data is good data.Rather than encouraging “big data” analytics, we should be encouraging “relevant data”and “proportionate data”analytics, especially in the context of those made by or carried out in relation to Government and public bodies.3.Whilst some algorithms are designed to provide yes/no answers, increasingly that is not the sole purpose.   Indeed as we have seen from therecent “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the UK”1paper published by the Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jerome Pesenti, the push appears to be for algorithms to infiltrate and impact every corner of our data driven lives.  We feel profoundlynervous of such proposals and stress that caution is applied to the optimism of a perfect world which the paper tends to err towards.  4.Firstly human beings are nuanced.  There is no such thing as one size fits all in terms of people.  All legislative decisions will have positive and negative outcomes depending on how the law impacts the individual.  Whilst broad laws are necessary to help society to function, the role of using algorithms to offer precision to those laws is not necessarily going to provide better outcomes.\n\n\n\n"

Mr Anderson was supported in his work by three team members.  Dr Bob Mowill a former Director of Technology and Engineering at GCHQ but now an independent security consultant, Gordon Meldrum former Director of Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Cathryn McGahey QC, barrister and QC in criminal and civil cases.

Secondly, we raise the issue that the custody image database is oversized and is highly likely to retain images unlawfully. The antiquateddatabase of 21 million photos stores imagesof innocent people who neither received a conviction nor are of any policing interest. The storage of such photos was ruled unlawful in 2012 by the High Court in RMC and FJ v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and Secretary of State for the Home Department.

This   China-style   mass   surveillance   tool   risks   turningCCTV cameras into biometric checkpoints and citizens into walking ID cards.Incompatible with human rights: We explore the impact of live facial recognitionsurveillance   on   human   rights   in   the   UK   and   explain   why   such   biometriccheckpoints cannot be compatible with the rights framework.Discriminatory:  Furthermore, research has found that many live facial recognitionalgorithms   have   discriminatory   effect,   disproportionately   misidentifyingblack people and women.No law, policy or safeguards: Parliament has never passed a law enabling policeuse   of   facial   recognition   surveillance.   There   are   no   laws   and   no   safeguardsregulating this alarming expansion of surveillance in the UK. Ineffective:    Over   recent   years,   live   facial   recognition   has   proven   to   bedangerously   inaccurate,   producing   high   numbers   of   ‘false   positive’   matches.Police   have   accrued  thousands   of   false   positive   matches  of   members   of   thepublic whose photos have been subsequently taken and, for a period, stored.Over-policing:   Big   Brother   Watch   has   witnessed  innocent   members   of   thepublic   being   misidentified,   stopped   and   searched   –  including   a   14  year   oldblack boy in school uniform. We have also witnessed people being stopped andforced   to   show   identification, and in one case even  fined, for wearing hoodedjackets or having scarves covering their chins in winter weather.

This one example alone shows that ill-considered and poorly executed data sharing often makes the vulnerable even more so. It wasdetermined by the Supreme Court3earlier in the year that sharing personal information for the benefit of “wellbeing” failed to meet the high bar set by the Data Protection Act which says data use must be “vital”.\n\n\n\n"

You can watch it here or read the Hansard transcript below.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you to our next two witnesses for being here promptly. We will now hear evidence from Big Brother Watch and the Open Rights Group. For this session we again have broadly half an hour to 45 minutes. Will the witnesses please read their names into the record?\n\nJim Killock: I am Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group.\n\nRenate Samson: I am Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch. We were also a member of the open policy making group and the Privacy and Consumer Advisory Group, to which Dr Whitley referred to earlier.\n\nThe Chair: Thank you. I turn first to Louise Haigh.\n\nLouise Haigh: I will pick up where we left off, if that is okay. You were both involved in the consultation process for part 5 of the Bill. Did the proposals come as a surprise to you? Do they make sense to you as data experts?\n\nRenate Samson: No, they do not make very much sense, if I am honest. As I said, we were a member of the open policy making process and we also submitted to the consultation. I am genuinely surprised that after a two-year process, all of a sudden it felt very rushed. There were conversations and meetings happening right up to the Queen’s Speech; there was still a general lack of clarity, particularly on safeguards, and many questions were still being asked, such as how, why, when and so on. The next thing we knew, it was in the Queen’s Speech and the Bill was published.\n\nReading through part 5—and I have read through it a lot and scratched my head a great deal, mainly for the reasons given in evidence earlier today—you see that the codes of practice, which would explain an awful lot of what we imagine is meant or may not be meant, just have not been published. I have repeatedly asked for them and been given various expected dates, and we are sitting here today without them but with the Bill already having been laid before Parliament.\n\nWe have also done a lot of work on the Investigatory Powers Bill, for which the codes of practice were there right from the start. There was clarity as to what was intended and what was going to be legislated for, straight up. So, I am profoundly disappointed, because data sharing and digital government are hugely important and we seem to be very far away after a very long process.\n\n\n\n"

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

If the visited network is outside the home country, this is known as international roaming.\n\nIf the visited network operates on a different technical standard than the home network, this is known as inter-standard roaming.\n\nGSM Roaming, which involves roaming between GSM networks, offers the mobile subscriber the convenience of being able to use a single number, a single bill and a single phone in up to 219 countries. The convenience of GSM Roaming has been a key driver behind the global success of the GSM Platform.\n\n\n\n"

It was to be a collaborative space for all mankind.\n\nHowever, when the first browser that popularized the web came along, called Mosaic, it included multimedia and editing was taken out. It was considered too difficult a problem. This change was the first curtailing of the web’s promise and spawned an effort led by Tim and others to get the write functionality back.

Historically, the news media – print, radio, and television – has provided the spaces where competing narratives are publicly debated. Today, technology companies are the dominant curators of information and their engineering of a public sphere is significantly different than that of news media enterprises, even news media organizations who are beholden to state or corporate interests.\n\nCan Google render unpopular perspectives invisible? How are relationships between powerful actors, governments, and corporations shaping what “we” see or don’t see online? The cultural, economic, political, and moral pressures that prevent these companies from taking these actions are not inscribed in global law or limited by technology. Around the world, we see a variety of cases where political actors actively manipulate technology for their own gain, through censorship, disinformation, and authoritarian control. Even in the United States, where free speech theoretically reigns, the government is increasingly pressuring technology companies to algorithmically identify terrorists, for example, and provide backdoors for their manipulation.\n\nThis project sought to map how the public sphere is currently understood, controlled, and manipulated in order to spark a richer conversation about what interventions should be considered to support the ideal of an informed and engaged citizenry. In addition, this project mapped existing concerns and research already underway in this field and enlisted the advice and aid of a group of scholars who were engaged in this area.\n\n\n\n"

Our  thesis  is  that  blockchains,  or  more generically  distributed  ledgers,  are  a  potentially powerful new tool for “identity roots” — the starting points for an Internet identity. However “blockchain identity” may not fully address the core security and privacy  principles  needed  in  a  complete  identity system.

By focusing on theneeds of real people, we hope to also encourage developers, engineers, and software business owners to create the apps that will address their reluctance and fulfll their needs, making self-sovereign identity a reality\n\n\n\n"

By doing so, DPKI addresses many usability and security challenges that plague traditional public key infrastructure (PKI). DPKI has advantages at each stage of the PKI life cycle. It makes permissionless bootstrapping of online identities possible and provides for the simple creation of stronger SSL certificates.

This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self-sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals —from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.\n\n\n\n"

However, it’s also a phrase that dates back almost twenty-five years and has been heavily overloaded with meaning during that time. The classic definition of Web of Trust derives from PGP, but the top Google results refer to a website reputation rating system created by a Finnish internet company. Meanwhile, some use it as a big tent that includes identity authentication & verification, certificate validation, and reputation assessment, while the vibrant blockchain community is also drawing new attention to the classic concept.To build a contemporary Web of Trust, we need to better define it. To do so, we must both understand what the classic Web of Trust was and create a model for the elements of trust that are contained within a more modern definition.\n\n\n\n"

Given the evident limitations of this design, we propose an alternative with more powerful capabities, based on the ability to explicitly outline and fully program conditions for verification. These conditions would then be used to determine when a signature or set of signatures can be considered valid.Our inspiration for this authorization system is the bitcoin scripting language, where the authorization to spend funds is explicitly defined within a script, rather than being implicitly defined through the reference to an authorized public key. The largest benefit of explicit specification of authorization conditions is that the system is fully extensible, so new operations can be defined at any time, with the only limitation being the set of operations that the authorization interpreters understand.\n\n\n\n"

Central to the approach is leveraging the emerging DID (decentralized identifer) standard. The term autonomic means self-managing or self-regulating. In the context of data, we crystalize the meaning of self-managing to include cryptographic techniques for maintaining data provenance that make the data self-identifying, self-certifying, and self-securing. Implied thereby is the use of cryptographic keys and signatures to provide a root of trust for data integrity and to maintain that trust over transformation of that data, e.g. provenance. Thus key management must be a frst order property of DADs. This includes key reproduction, rotation, and recovery. The pre-rotation and hybrid recovery methods presented herein are somewhat novel.\n\n\n\n"

Third  parties must  now  obtain  explicit  and  documented  consent from people (data subjects) to collect, process, store or  disclose  their  personal  data.  A  specification  for operationalising these regulatory requirements, using digital Consent Receipts, is being developed through the   Consent   and   Information-Sharing   Working Group of the Kantara Initiative.

New    technology    and    automated    systems,    encompassing    artificial intelligence, machine learningand big data analyticsare being used ever more widely in the criminal  justice  system.  These  are  being  used  to  predict  communities  to  target  with greater police  resources;  to  assess  individuals’risk  of  committing  crimes  in  the  future;  to  identify suspects in public places; and to supportpolice investigations.However,  these  new  systems  have  evidenced  some  extremely  concerning  biases.  There  are significant problems with the data being used to build and train these models, while some of those  building  the  models  have  shownlittle  regard  for  data  protection  or  human  rights.  This has  resulted  in  biased  and  discriminatory decisionsthat  are  in  large  part  automated,  with serious implications for the fairness of criminal justice. The protections afforded to individuals subject  to  these  biased,  unfair  or  unjust decisions  are  minimal.

It was developed by DurhamPolice in conjunction with academics and has been in use since 2017. The AI risk predictions guide decisions as to whether a suspect should be charged or releasedonto the ‘Checkpoint’ rehabilitation programme. Moderate risk’ suspects are informed that ifthey successfully complete the Checkpoint programme they will not receive a criminal convictionWe focus on this tool because it is one of the most significant examples of algorithms in thejustice system in the UK, and was the topic of an investigation by Big Brother Watch in 2018.

Clearly this is an issue and law enforcement has tobe able to respond effectively. Key to helping the police deal with the risingnumber ofconcerns is the idea of registering drones. Without a workable system of registration for privately used drones it could be argued that very little progresscanbe made towards policing their use or making sure they are flown in a legal way. Registration is a process which needs to be given serious consideration sooner rather than later. The longer a system takes toimplement the more drones willneed to be registered retrospectivelyincreasingthe administrative burdens needed to make the system effective.Whilst speed is of the essence it shouldn’t be an excuse to cut corners. Whatever system is introduced has to inspire confidence in both members of the public and users, be sensible, easyto administerand easy to promote.\n\n\n\n"

Biometrics now extends to but is not limited to DNA, facial search, gait, iris recognition, speech recognition, facial recognition. While useful in preventing, detecting and prosecuting crime, the capturing and storing and searching of biometric identifiers violates individual and group privacy. There is a need to ensure that the use of biometrics identifiers occurs within a governance framework that strikes a balance between public security and fundamental rights to privacy and data protection. It should also be acknowledged that other rights are engaged where this technology is used in public spaces, including the freedom of association and assembly, and freedom of expression.We are supportive of the Scottish Government’s legislation to create a Scottish Biometrics Commissioner. However, the scope of the Biometrics Commissioner is too narrow. Limiting the competencies of the regulator to law enforcement does not reflect the realities of the way biometrics are used in society.\n\n\n\n"

We address one of those issues in this submission. 3Far greater clarity is required in the Bill andin the draft Codes of Practice.  Currently the Codes of Practice are riddled with poor drafting, incoherence and lack of clarity.

The Court ruled on two issues in relation to communicationsdata. The first element precludes the  general  and  indiscriminate  retention  of  communications  data.  The  second clarifies  that communications data may only be retained and accessed in relation to fighting serious crime, after  independent  authorisation  has  been  granted,  in  addition  to  other  safeguards.In  light  of the CJEU’s judgment, the UK’s regime urgently requires a serious overhaul.\n\n\n\n"

Governance, as in business and fnancing structure, is arguably the most challenging of these properties, captured succinctly by Shoshana Zubof as: \"Who decides? Who decides who decides?\" However,even though the technology has matured greatly over recent years, bootstrapping an SSI product within the existing capitalistic market environment is complicated and has not been achieved at scale within any functional domain.A RWOT6 paper explored the challenges to a sustainable commons. In this paper, we apply the SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) to identify potential paths to adoption. For example, what are the general implications of introducing a credential holder into existing issuer/verifer relationships? Our analysis leads to cooperative (in the legal sense) governance with focus on the holder (the wallet) as the key innovation, since issuers and verifers already exist. The healthcare industry is used as an example.\n\n\n\n"

The use of publicly available, corporate, and government data sets may reveal human practices, behaviors, and interactions in unintended ways, creating the need for new kinds of ethical support. Secondary data use invokes privacy and consent concerns. A team at Data & Society recently conducted interviews and campus visits with computer science researchers and librarians at eight U.S. universities to examine the role of research librarians in assisting technical researchers as they navigate emerging issues of privacy, ethics, and equitable access to data at different phases of the research process.\n\n\n\n"
