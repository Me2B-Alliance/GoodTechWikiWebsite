title: "Equitable Internet Initiative"
---

From July: 2016 to January: 2018: we will work together to ensure that more Detroit residents have the ability to leverage digital technologies for social and economic development.

The goals of this initiative are to:

increase Internet access through the distribution of shared Gigabit Internet connections in three underserved neighborhoods;
increase Internet adoption through a Digital Stewards training program that prepares residents of those same neighborhoods with the skills necessary to bring their communities online; and
increase pathways for youth into the opportunities of Detroit's burgeoning Innovation District through intermediate and advanced digital literacy trainings.
