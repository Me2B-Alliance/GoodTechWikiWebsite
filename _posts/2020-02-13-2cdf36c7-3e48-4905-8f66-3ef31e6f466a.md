title: "Trustless Computing Certification Body (TCCB)"
---

Since 2013, the Trustless Computing Association has been building a uniquely accountable, resilient and independent Trustless Computing Certification Body (“TCCB”) – and an initial compliant open ecosystem, computing base and 2mm-thin human computing device – aimed to achieve radically-unprecedented levels of trustworthiness for the confidentiality and integrity of the most critical IT systems, while concurrently ensuring legitimate lawful access, to prevent criminal abuse. 

Initially for the most sensitive human communications and transactions of tens of millions of World citizens, it will evolve to certify root-of-trust sub-systems of the most society-critical  IT systems in the areas of social media, autonomous, AI, 5G, IoT, cyber-physical, and public security systems.

It will be a private international standards setting and certification body that will issue a label that IT providers can apply for, in compliance with all current EU and Swiss laws, and downward compatibility with EU eIDAS Qualified and the future Swiss eID LoT3.
