title: "OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices"
---

This specification provides guidance on the proper encoding of responses to OAuth 2.0 Authorization Requests in which the request uses a Response Type value that includes space characters. Furthermore, this specification registers several new Response Type values in the OAuth Authorization Endpoint Response Types registry.

This specification also defines a Response Mode Authorization Request parameter that informs the Authorization Server of the mechanism to be used for returning Authorization Response parameters from the Authorization Endpoint.
