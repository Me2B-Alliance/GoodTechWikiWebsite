Mission
Allied Media Projects (AMP) cultivates media for liberation. Our media includes all the ways we communicate with the world. Our liberation is an ongoing process of personal: collective: and systemic transformation. We are a network of people and projects: rooted in Detroit and connected to hundreds of other places across the globe. Together: we grow and exchange ways of using media to create the world we need.*

Vision
*AMP envisions and attempts to model a world in which we: collectively:

Care for ourselves: each other: other species: and the planet;
Dismantle supremacist systems as they operate upon us and within us;
Assume responsibility for creating new liberatory ways of being: and;
Cultivate life affirming joy.
