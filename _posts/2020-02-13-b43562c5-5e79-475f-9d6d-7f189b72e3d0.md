MIDATA shows how data can be used for the common good, while at the same time ensuring the citizensâ€™ control over their personal data.The MIDATA model is designed for international application: MIDATA Switzerland supports the foundation of regional or national MIDATA cooperatives that share the data platform infrastructure.Owners of a data account at MIDATA may actively contribute to medical research and clinical studies by granting selective access to their personal data. They may become members of the cooperative and thereby control the cooperative.
