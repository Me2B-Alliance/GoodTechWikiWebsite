title: "Cryptography and Security Mechanisms WG2"
---

WG 2 provides a center of expertise for the standardization of IT Security techniques and mechanisms within JTC 1.
Terms of Reference:
* identify the need and requirements for these techniques and mechanisms in IT systems and applications;
* develop terminology, general models and standards for these techniques and mechanisms for use in security services.

The scope covers both cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques and mechanisms including:
* confidentiality;
* entity authentication;
* non-repudation;
* key management;
* data integrity such as message authentication;
** hash-functions;
** digital signatures.
The mechanisms in general include several options with respect to the techniques used including symmetric cryptographic, asymmetric cryptographic and non-cryptographic.
