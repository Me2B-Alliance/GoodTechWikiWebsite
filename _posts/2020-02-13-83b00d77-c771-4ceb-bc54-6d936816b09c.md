title: "Patient Privacy Rights Information Governance Label"
---

Note: 0-to-5 of the boxes to be checked by the application, device, or service provider.
▢ 1. ​ No sharing: ​ The data is never shared with any external entities.​ It is not even shared in
de-identified form.
▢ 2. ​ No aggregation:​ The data is never aggregated with other types of input or data from
external sources.​ This includes mixing the data gathered via The Service with other data, such
as patient-reported outcomes.
▢ 3. ​ Always voluntary self-identification: ​ The user of The Service is able to choose their own
identity. ​ The user does not need to have their identity verified unless required by law.
▢ 4. ​ Digital agent support:​ The user is able to specify a digital agent, trustee, or equivalent
information manager, and this specified agent will not be subject to certification or
censorship.
▢ 5. ​ No vendor lock-in:​ The Service is easily and conveniently substitutable, so the user can
easily move their data to another vendor providing a similar service.​ This prevents vendor
lock-in and is often accomplished using Open Standards.
Indications for Use:​ The five separately self-asserted statements on the PPR Information
Governance Label are subject to legal enforcement as would the privacy policy associated with
The Service.
