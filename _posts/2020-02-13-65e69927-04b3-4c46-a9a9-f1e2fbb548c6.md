Risk  management  allows  to  determine  the  precautions  to  take  "with  regard  to  the nature of the data and the risksof the processing,to preserve the security of the data..." (article 34 Act of 6th January 1978, known as the act on "Information technology, Data files and Civil Liberties" â€“ hereafter referred to as the French Data Protection and Freedoms Act or FDPFA). The 2016/679 European regulation of 27th April 2016 (known as "General Data Protection Regulation" or GDPR) specifies that protecting personal data requires taking "appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk" (article 32).Such  an  approach  allows  for  objective  decision  making  and  the  determination  of    the measures strictly necessary and suitable to the context. It is, however, often dif-ficult, when you are not familiar with these methods, to apply such an approach and to ensure that the required measures have indeed been implemented. To  help  you  with  complying  with  your  legal  obligations,  this  guide  lists  the  basic  precautions which should be implemented systematically.
