title: "Report: International Law and Policy Workshop 2"
---

The goal of this Amsterdam workshop was to build on the outcomes of the Washington event by bringing together technology, policy, and legal leaders to talk about identity in the context of European regulations, explore potential International integration and agreements as well as the secondary effort of the GOV.UK Verify programme, to accelerate market identity services. OIX will continue these threads throughout this year at the Cloud Identity Summit (CIS) in the summer and London later this year.
