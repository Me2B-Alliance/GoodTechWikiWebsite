Organizing Tech Against Hate. Technology platforms promised us connection: access: and democracy but instead are radicalizing and fragmenting communities by providing an unprecedented ability to coordinate attacks and amplify hate. Five years ago: when relentless harassment in the gamer community against three women game developers happened: underrepresented people sounded an alarm. People of color: the LGBTQIA+ community: and others warned and continue to warn us about how tech platforms are used to abuse: and how it keeps getting worse. In a time where mass shootings have become tragically more commonplace: the recent string of shootings in Gilroy: El Paso: and Dayton have shaken us to our core.
