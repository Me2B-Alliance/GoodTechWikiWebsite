On this weekâ€™s episode of The Open Mind, we welcome Algorithmic Justice League founder Joy Buolamwini. Her organization's mission is to highlight algorithmic bias through media, art and science, to provide space for people to voice concerns and experiences with coded bias and to develop practices for accountability during the design, development, and deployment of coded systems.
