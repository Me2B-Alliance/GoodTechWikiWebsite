---

This document is an application of the PIA guides published by the CNIL to the specific sector of the IoT devices (connected objects). Performed in principle by a controller or provider, the purpose of a PIA is to build and demonstrate the implementation of privacy protection principles so as to empower data subjects. This is an iterative methodology, which should guarantee a reasoned, reliable use of such data during processing.This document is based upon the PIA method of the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL)The methodology comprises three guides, one setting out the approach, a second containing facts that could  be  used  for  formalizing  the  analysis  and  a  third  providing  knowledge  bases  (a  catalogue  of  controls aimed at complying with the legal requirements and treating the risks, and examples): These can be downloaded from the CNIL website and will be useful for completing this document:
